# Goal
Our goal is to get people voting more in **off-cycle elections** than in **federal elections**

*Clearvote is an all-in-one service that enables users to stay up-to-date on off-cycle elections and understand who they are voting for*

## Why

- We believe that if people were to participate in off-cycle elections more than the federal elections, we would see a revolutionary shift in power that enables communities to be more adaptable and engaged. On an individual level, this would grant personal agency to the individual need to prevent authoritarianism from taking root in society, enabling more well-intentioned innovations driven by higher ideals. Preventing authoritarianism is our only political agenda. So why is do we believe this is so important?
    - Authoritarian rulership prevents humanity from seeking truth and aspiring to higher ideals. These ideals can enable innovation driven by a higher purpose, as opposed to those driven by nationalism or capital. With enough of these ideals, we can shape society’s collective intent to one that strives to provide all life, present and future, with the means to achieve its full potential.
    - Enhancing the political agency of individuals is the best way to prevent Authoritarianism from taking control in human societies. Democracy does give people the means to exert this political agency, but it’s most effective at a smaller scale where:
        - constituents are more likely to interact with their representatives
        - representatives are more likely to consider their constituent’s needs
        - and faster, more effective action can be taken in a way that best fits the needs of the community

## How

**Urban** estimates for voter turnout in federal elections are around 70% with off-cycle elections in contests like primary elections being as low as 20%. Many people *are* interested in participating but do not, mainly because they either:

1. They do not even know there is an election going on
2. They don’t have the time to figure out how to participate
3. They are not able to keep track of the key dates and miss the voting schedule
4. Even worse, ballots themselves tend to be vague and require busy would-be voters to read complicated voter pamphlets read between the lines from biased articles and news sources to figure out what the people they are voting for really represent. Those who don’t opt out entirely are prone to vote for a person purely on the basis of their political party and not the values they actually represent

Our service makes staying *up-to-date* and *informed* on off-cycle elections easy with clear instructions and alerts that tell them exactly *what to do* and most importantly: ***what the values are of the candidates on their ballot***
