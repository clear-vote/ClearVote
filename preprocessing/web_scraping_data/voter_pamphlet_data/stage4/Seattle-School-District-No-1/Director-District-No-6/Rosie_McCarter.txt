Education: WSA Parent Ambassadors
Occupation: Shelter Counselor at New Horizons Ministries
Statement: My name is Rosie she/her/they/them/their pronouns.
Thank you for this opportunity. I work at New Horizons Ministries with homeless young adults and a few grassroots organizations. I am running because I feel like low income familes which make up a signiﬁ  cant majority of the population of Seattle aren’t being heard nor truly represented. Also I am tired of the dumpster ﬁ  re we call the education system. We are failing the children and disproportionally kids that are part of the BIPOC communities. Not to mention low income families and the kids that qualify for special education and those furthest from educational justice. I am considered ‘low-income’ born and raised. Sitting below the poverty line. I am a Native, a proud Cherokee and Nez Perce . A member and family in the  LGBTQIA 2 spirit community. I am neurodiverse as is my youngest. Which has received or are receiving special education services. As low-income my family depends on free meals at school, Apple Health, and Food Stamps. No one knows or understands the struggles of poverty like someone who’s lived it or is living it. I feel that anywhere decisions are being made everyone should be present and have a say. My lived experience tells me that now is the best time to run for the school board position. I have the knowledge and skills bestowed upon me by amazing programs like Policy Council with the PSESD, The Agents of Change Cohort, and most importantly Washington State Association 
of head start and early head start Parent Ambassadors program. They 
have provided me with the tools I need to work with my communities and advocate for them. I hope you will allow me to do that.
