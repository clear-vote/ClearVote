Statement: Statement:  40-year West Seattle resident, 3 grandchildren 
in Seattle Public Schools (SPS), 1 with special needs.Restoring conﬁ  dence in our schools that have lost the support of 
families and communities they serve is key. Parents, students, and teachers need to be better informed and consulted about education demands and budget priorities. SPS’s decision making process lacks 
transparency. Elect me to the School Board and I will work tirelessly to 
change that. 
Seattle Public Schools faces declining enrollments, budget 
deﬁ  cits, elimination of resources and programs, possible closures, consolidation, teacher and staﬀ   layoﬀ  s according to an article published by the Seattle Times in April of 2023.  SPS is facing an 
estimated $131 million deﬁ  cit for 2023-24 and $92 million for 2024-25 
yet they are still planning to construct large, one-size-ﬁ  ts-all buildings to replace aging schools.
I live by Alki Elemetary which is proposed for a giant expansion despite 
city declining enrollment. This will harmfully close other schools. I will vote to halt and dial back this project. There are similar harmful projects at Montlake and Rogers Elementaries.
The new schools provide no parking for staﬀ   or parents. ADA parking 
is insuﬃ   cient.The Alki school rebuild and remodel is an example of this. I will work tirelessly to  make sure projects are scaled back if they 
can’t be paid for or don’t have full community support.  If you can’t get 
your chilld to the school, they can’t be educated.
