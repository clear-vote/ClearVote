Statement: Seattle, we need to pivot. Our city is heading toward a 
higher-cost, lower-quality of life. We’ve taken the wrong approach to our problems, let them get worse, and used the wrong tools to manage them.
Take homelessness . The current approach is to help people living 
on the streets so they can get back on their feet. The reality is most 
chronically homeless people have never been on their feet. Most suﬀ  er from mental illness and addiction problems. They don’t need free meals or shelter. They need rehab and treatment.
We need a Social Services Department to provide these services 
and handle many problems currently falling to the Seattle Police Department. Let’s not criminalize homelessness, but treat it as a public health issue. If necessary, we should use civil commitment  laws 
to mandate treatment for those who are a danger to themselves or others.
We’ve also taken the wrong approach to housing , believing that more 
supply will lower prices. But despite all the homes we’ve built, rents 
and prices still rise. That’s because private developers only build market rate housing as long as market rates remain high. We need to build aﬀ  ordable housing for people who earn at or below the median income. The new social housing oﬃ   ce is a step in this direction.
Addressing homelessness and housing aﬀ  ordability will chart a new 
path for Seattle. People in crisis will get the help they need. The police can stay in their lane. Our libraries can be learning centers instead of de facto homeless shelters. Our jails will no longer function as mental institutions. Our parks will be free of tents and needles.
Let’s pull Seattle in this hopeful direction, toward a higher-quality of 
life for everyone.
