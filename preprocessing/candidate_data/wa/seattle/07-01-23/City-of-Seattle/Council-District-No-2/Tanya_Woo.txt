Education: University of Washington, Bachelors of Arts in

Occupation: Business Owner, Community Advocate
Statement: I grew up in Beacon Hill, work at my family business in 
the Chinatown International District and now live in Rainier Beach. I’ve seen how South Seattle has changed, I’ve seen what happens to neighborhoods that don’t have a voice and are expected to live with bad city policies. I want to change that.
As a community advocate, I’ve fought against continued discrimination 
from the city towards the CID, recently named one of the most endangered neighborhoods in America. I learned that ﬁ  ghting for our voice when the city imposes their will without listening to our 
community, is a ﬁ  ght we can win. I want to bring that same passion to 
ﬁ  ght for all of South Seattle.
I know how to achieve better public safety. Every week, I practice what 
alternative policing looks like with my community watch group that prevents violence while working with ﬁ  rst responders when needed, and provides mutual aid to the unhoused in the CID. 
I know how to create more aﬀ  ordable housing. My family renovated 
the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing which only charges residents a percentage of their income so nobody is charged rent 
they cannot aﬀ  ord. This model can be used to ﬁ  ght displacement and 
gentriﬁ  cation across South Seattle.
We need to move past elected leaders telling us what they’re going to 
do, but never showing up to hear what people really want. We need leaders that listen to the community even when it’s not politically convenient, and do the hard work it takes to run Seattle. Together we can uplift South Seattle to be the place we know it can be.  I promise to show up, work hard and help make Seattle better, together. 
Endorsed by Representative Sharon Tomiko-Santos, Seattle Port 
Commissioners Sam Cho and Toshiko Hasegawa, and more.
