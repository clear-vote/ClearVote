Education: Institute for a Democratic Future, University of 
Washington, Ingraham High School
Occupation: Community activist
Statement: I am a lifelong resident of District 5, where I have been an 
active volunteer for over 20 years and am now raising my own family.
I was the ﬁ  rst candidate to ﬁ  le in this race, and am running because 
I love our city, our city is in crisis, and I have the skills, track-record, relationships and energy needed to help. My campaign priorities are public safety, including behavioral health, substance abuse, prostitution, theft, vandalism, hate crimes and gun violence; homelessness and aﬀ  ordable housing for all, including renters, seniors and other residents on ﬁ  xed incomes; protecting businesses, public spaces, the environment, and the unique character of Seattle and its neighborhoods; and accessibility, transparency and accountability from public servants and law enforcement.
In District 5, I have served on the Broadview Community Council, 
on the executive board of the 46th District Democrats, as a precinct committee oﬃ   cer, and as a creek steward for Broadview Creek. I have served as president of the UW Alumni Association’s Multicultural Alumni Partnership, the Metropolitan Democratic Club of Seattle, and the Church Council of Greater Seattle. I have worked as an event planner for the UW Alumni Association, a chapter administrator for the Seattle United Nations Association, and a loaned executive for the United Way of King County.
I am proud to be endorsed by WA Attorney-General Bob Ferguson, 
King County Executive Dow Constantine, King County Assessor John Wilson, King County Councilmember Jeanne Kohl-Welles, WA Representative Sharon Tomiko Santos, former King County Councilmember Larry Gossett, former Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes, former Seattle City Councilmembers Peter Steinbrueck, Nick 
Licata, Heidi Wills, and David Della; former WA Senator Maralyn Chase, 
Ben Bridge Co-CEO and General Counsel Jon Bridge, the Metropolitan Democratic Club of Seattle, and many others.
I would be honored to have your vote!
