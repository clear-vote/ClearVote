Education: University of Washington BA in English
Occupation: Longshoreman/Dockworker
Statement: My name is Mia Jacobson. I am 35 years old, a third 
generation West Seattleite, a third generation union longshoreman, and a single mother of three. I was born in the house that I’m raising kids in, which means I’ve watched District 1 change over my lifetime and I am invested in its future. This is my community. This is my children’s community. I want this community to sustain in these radically changing times. 
I spent nearly 5 years attempting to enter into the local legislative 
process as a private citizen and found it systematically impossible to do so. This led me to recognize the inadequacy of our current process when trying to best address our issues. My experience growing up in a union family has shown me the impact that a culture of solidarity, democracy, and community organization can have when negotiating relationships of power and creating policy that eﬀ  ectively serves the collective.
My campaign is rooted in systemic change so that we can better 
address the problems we face in our community. If elected, I will work to improve citizen access to the legislative process, to introduce transparency and accountability within our system of local governance, and to celebrate community organization and empowerment. 
I believe that we have outgrown the system of representation as 
we collectively step into a new era of being human. Our current 
technological advancement has created a fundamentally diﬀ  erent kind 
of citizen. We now have access to the information needed to become a valuable contributor to the conversation which creates legislation. We can coordinate within large numbers in a digital space to discuss our local policies 24 hours a day. It is time to shift our focus from the powers that be - to the powers that we have become.
