Statement: I am running because I am passionate about Seattle.  I 
moved here over 25 years ago when Seattle was rated the most livable 
city.in the country. Ask yourself if you can say that now? I have a vision 
of Seattle once again leading the country in livability.This is an historic time in Seattle, particularly because growth 
management has been an unmitigated failure
. Traﬃ   c is a mess, housing 
is unaﬀ  ordable, bridges are crumbling, and our neighbors are literally 
sleeping in the streets.  As President of Seattle Fair Growth, I have 
been advocating for housing for people of all incomes.
Before I built a small business from scratch into one of the Fastest 
Growing Companies in Washington, I was a starving radio announcer barely able to pay rent.  I know what it is to live paycheck to paycheck. We must incentivize developers to build aﬀ  ordable housing on site, not pay a fee to build it somewhere else on cheaper land four years later.
The recent update to Seattle’s Tree Ordinance is an example of the 
failure of our city’s leadership. Multiple amendments recommended by the Urban Forestry Commission were summarily rejected. Combined with the State’s Middle Housing Act, which requires multifamily zoning throughout Seattle, who stands for the trees? Are we the Emerald City or beholden to special interests? Subsidized multifamily housing close to transit is part of the balance that Seattle needs. We can have trees and we can have aﬀ  ordable housing too.
As your future City Council member, I will not be taking contributions 
from the Master Builders of King County. I will be working for one constituency, you. Together we can make Seattle green again!
