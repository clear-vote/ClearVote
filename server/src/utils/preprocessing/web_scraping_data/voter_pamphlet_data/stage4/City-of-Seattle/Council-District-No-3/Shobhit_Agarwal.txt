Occupation: Ex- Senior Program Manager, Microsoft, PMP; Actor; 
CashierStatement: 
I am a ﬁ  rst-generation gay immigrant from India and have 
lived in Seattle since 2002. From working as a program manager at 
Microsoft to pursuing the dream as an actor to working retail, I have experienced the struggles of work at every level. I am also a member of the SAG-AFTRA union.
I have served on my condo HOA board for ﬁ  ve years. This role has 
enabled me to listen to my constituents, be empathetic to their problems and focus on ﬁ  nding and implementing solutions.   
I get the job done!
My platform prioritizes advancing green infrastructure across the city. 
This includes expanding Sound Transit with last mile loop buses. I will also work with Seattle City Light to expand electric infrastructure. This will enable the expansion of electric cars throughout the city. The green energy industry should provide opportunities for local businesses, and I especially want to support businesses owned by women, people of color and sexual minorities.
I want to make housing more aﬀ  ordable by de-zoning, leveraging 
I-135 and reducing competition from non-resident investors. I believe in compassionate solutions for homelessness. I believe in enhancing public safety by hiring local Seattleites for our police and ﬁ  re departments while ensuring equal opportunity for all historically excluded communities.
I support reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, and worker rights 
to organize. I want to streamline the process and resolve local constituent concerns like potholes and damaged pavements in a timely manner. I am in this race because I want to build a more prosperous and equitable Seattle.
