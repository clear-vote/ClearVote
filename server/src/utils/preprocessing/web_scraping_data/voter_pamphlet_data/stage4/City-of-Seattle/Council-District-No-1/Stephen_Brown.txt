Education: MBA, Stanford University, BA in History, McGill University
Occupation: President and founder of Eltana Bagels
Statement: I am running for Seattle City Council to approach Seattle’s 
challenges with vision and pragmatism. And we desperately need both! I will bring that combination of talents to incentivize the development of more aﬀ  ordable homes to move our unhoused residents oﬀ   the streets and into services. We also need a renewed push to develop middle-income housing so that nurses, teachers, mechanics and those on ﬁ  xed incomes can continue to call Seattle their home. Let’s further restrict access to guns and promote safety in every neighborhood. I will support our small businesses and help revitalize Downtown.
I have the ideas, skills and leadership experience to move our city 
forward.  
I began to consider running for council a few years ago when I decided 
to keep Eltana Bagels open and un-boarded during the height of the George Floyd protests and ensuing CHOP occupancy. I could have followed the vast majority of businesses at the time and closed my doors or joined some of my neighboring businesses in their grievance lawsuit against the city. I did not. Instead, I listened to the needs of the community and my employees. Everyone kept their jobs and our doors stayed open. That is leadership and that is what is sorely needed on the Seattle City Council. 
I am driven by bringing the best ideas to light and to life. I am the only 
candidate in the District 1 race who has developed ideas into plans that actually work. Not only that, I have used those plans to create entities that have operated successfully for long stretches of time. I 
lead with the values of candor, curiosity, and generosity. My candidacy 
is about the future, about the Seattle we can build together with creativity, courage, discipline, and hard work. I would be honored to earn your vote.
