Education: Applied science degree in electronic engineering
Occupation: Technical consultant to the software industry
Statement: I have a long career in quality control, project 
management and auditing of ﬁ  nancial data systems. I will bring a high level of process scrutiny and logical problem solving to help in the school board’s decision making process.  I will use these skills in 
working with other board members and district staﬀ   to root out waste 
or ineﬃ   ciencies that exist in our school district management. 
This is my third campaign running for the Seattle school board and we all know it’s diﬃ   cult to get elected in Seattle unless you are seen as an 
activist. I’m not an activist just a Seattle Public Schools graduate and father of 3 Seattle Public School’s students who wants to see some 
stability , logic and ﬁ  scal responsibility return to Seattle Public Schools management. I believe my experience can help this district by pushing 
the narrative around school safety, the budget shortfall, capacity planning and outsourcing departments but it won’t be just talk!
I’m pledging at a minimum to have open and honest bi-weekly 
community meetings and an open door policy for anyone who needs help.
