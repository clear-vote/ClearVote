class Drafter:
    """
    This class is responsible for drafting the issues for each candidate in a given district
    Every candidate gets a unique value assigned to them with consideration of the following constraints:
    1. Drafts are assigned in rounds (no candidate can have more than 1 draft than anyone else with a non-empty value set)
    2. issues for each candidate are drafted in order of their most highly rated to most lowly rated
    3. If >1 candidate in a round shares the same highest rated value, the candidate with the highest rating gets it drafted to them

    In doing this, we are consciously preventing specific issuesets from standing out
    1. logistic issuesets; which I believe represents polarizing candidates who only focus on short-term, hot-button issues
    2. flat issuesets; which I believe represents people who are just trying to appease as many voters as possible
    We are also elevating other issuesets that I believe represents more nuanced and balanced leadership
    3. logit issuesets; which I believe represents candidates who aknowledge a wide body of issues but stress a few particularily important ones
    4. linear issuesets; which I believe represent candidates with a clear heirarchy of what is important to them, but are thoughtful on lower priority topics
