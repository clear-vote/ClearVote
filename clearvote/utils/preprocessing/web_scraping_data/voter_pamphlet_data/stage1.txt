Port of Seattle
/circle_arrow_right Commissioner Position No. 5
Education: MSc. Fisheries Biology, University of Washington. B.S. 
Psychology, University of Michigan.
Occupation: Seattle Port Commissioner 2016 – present [Past 
President]; Environmental Consultant.Statement: It has been a great honor to serve King County residents 
the past 7.5 years on the Seattle Port Commission. I’m running for a third term to continue my environmental leadership advancing a just and inclusive transition to a clean energy economy that generates living wage careers. 
My service is guided by a triple bottom line: commerce, community, 
and climate. I’m committed to expanding environmental and economic justice, especially for near-port communities, small and minority owned businesses.  My experience is needed to exercise public policy direction over a growing airport, homeport for cruise 
ships and ﬁ  shing ﬂ  eet, marinas, parks, and marine cargo Alliance with 
the Port of Tacoma.
The Port generates 121,000 jobs which is key to ongoing COVID 
recovery eﬀ  orts.  The airport and seaport have won awards for customer service even while undergoing major construction. Port activities also impact communities and the climate.  That’s why I’m leading initiatives to electrify airport and seaport operations and use of alternative fuels for trucks, ships, and planes.  I’m also committed to ensuring the protection and restoration of parks, bicycle safety and cleanup of the Duwamish River.
During my next term I’ll continue reducing the Port’s carbon 
footprint with unprecedented state and federal funding for clean energy projects; inspire youth to pursue Port-related jobs by promoting innovation, apprenticeships, and internships; and expand 
partnerships with Tribes and the Seattle Aquarium for projects on kelp 
to killer whales and ecotourism.
With your support, I’ll continue to champion Port policies rooted in 
ﬁ  scal responsibility, ecological integrity, and social equity. I respectfully 
ask for your vote.
Endorsed by: Attorney General Ferguson, Lands Commissioner 
Franz, Seattle Mayor Harrell, County Executive Constantine, County Councilmembers Balducci, Dembowski, Kohl-Welles, McDermott, Upthegrove and Zahilay, City Councilmember Mosqueda, Washington Conservation Action, King County Democrats, Labor Unions, and Business Leaders.

Education: MBA, City University of Seattle; BA Marketing, Boise State 
University; UW Paciﬁ  c Coast Banking School
Occupation: Mega Paciﬁ  c Holding, Managing Director; former CEO of 
two banksStatement: The Port of Seattle is embroiled in a management crisis. 
A billion-dollar terminal unsuitable for some of the large jets, $800 million in cost overruns, and a half-million loss to an internet scam. A staggering $83 million of new tax levy. Persistent environmental 
lawsuits hurting low-income communities and people of color in South 
King County. Time to set a new course.
We have a shared goal: A thriving economy, a cleaner environment, 
increased family wage jobs, and a fair and equitable society. To attain 
this, we must stop the path of mismanagement.
With my extensive career in banking and ﬁ  nance, I am ready to steer 
the Port in the right direction. As an immigrant who arrived with $300, I’ve worked my way up from the mailroom to the boardroom, founded two community banks, and provided hundreds of millions in small business loans and created thousands of jobs. I am a staunch promoter of ﬁ  scal responsibilities and know how to leverage them to create business opportunities for Washington State. I’ve served as a volunteered mentor MBA students at Seattle University, active in Rotary for 38 years, and Past President of the Greater Seattle Chinese Chamber of Commerce.
If elected, I will immediately put sound management practices 
into place to pull the Port back onto ﬁ  rm ﬁ  nancial ground with transparency.  This will enable us to focus on our dual mission: 
Generating family-wage jobs and safeguarding our environment.  Vote for 
a stronger, cleaner, and trusted Seattle Port.

Commissioner Position No. 5
Education: BSE Princeton; MS Engineering Texas; SM Management, 
SM Policy MIT; PhD Risk Assessment Union Institute
Occupation: Risk assessment consultant, aviation safety engineer, 
business ownerStatement: I’ve spent my 30-year career designing safety systems 
as an aerospace engineer, and using data to improve aviation policies and consumer conﬁ  dence. I’m running for Port of Seattle Commissioner because I want to use these skills to take the Port into the future: serving the traveling public with safety and transparency; protecting and creating jobs in marine trade and transport, and addressing the climate crisis through data and innovation. 
Breaking barriers and leading by example is a hallmark of my 
service—as an Air Force ﬂ  ight test engineer, opening doors as a Boeing engineer and union member, and working nationally to educate the public and policymakers on airline safety. I want to continue this work to bring more diversity and ideas into the Port—and its partners—through internships and apprenticeships, pipelines through our high schools and colleges to engage the workforce of tomorrow.   
Sea-Tac Airport is reaching capacity and no new airport will be built 
anytime soon– protecting rural lands, but forcing the Port to manage increasing ﬂ  ights, crowds, and security issues at our existing facility. My experience will be critical in addressing these challenges.
The Port must be a better neighbor to the communities it serves, 
and steward of our environment—meeting carbon reduction goals, 
accelerating adoption of clean fuels and renewable energy, and better 
integrating with the regional transportation network to move freight, people, and commerce.
I grew up with a father who fought in a segregated WWII Marine 
unit, and a Honduran mother who spoke Spanish in our home. As Port Commissioner I  will respect the values of fairness, equity, and opportunity that united our home—and our region. I’ll treat workers and communities with respect, and ensure the Port is a leader in our dynamic economy and global ambitions. I’d appreciate your vote.

/circle_arrow_right Council District No. 1
Education: MBA, Stanford University, BA in History, McGill University
Occupation: President and founder of Eltana Bagels
Statement: I am running for Seattle City Council to approach Seattle’s 
challenges with vision and pragmatism. And we desperately need both! I will bring that combination of talents to incentivize the development of more aﬀ  ordable homes to move our unhoused residents oﬀ   the streets and into services. We also need a renewed push to develop middle-income housing so that nurses, teachers, mechanics and those on ﬁ  xed incomes can continue to call Seattle their home. Let’s further restrict access to guns and promote safety in every neighborhood. I will support our small businesses and help revitalize Downtown.
I have the ideas, skills and leadership experience to move our city 
forward.  
I began to consider running for council a few years ago when I decided 
to keep Eltana Bagels open and un-boarded during the height of the George Floyd protests and ensuing CHOP occupancy. I could have followed the vast majority of businesses at the time and closed my doors or joined some of my neighboring businesses in their grievance lawsuit against the city. I did not. Instead, I listened to the needs of the community and my employees. Everyone kept their jobs and our doors stayed open. That is leadership and that is what is sorely needed on the Seattle City Council. 
I am driven by bringing the best ideas to light and to life. I am the only 
candidate in the District 1 race who has developed ideas into plans that actually work. Not only that, I have used those plans to create entities that have operated successfully for long stretches of time. I 
lead with the values of candor, curiosity, and generosity. My candidacy 
is about the future, about the Seattle we can build together with creativity, courage, discipline, and hard work. I would be honored to earn your vote.

Occupation: Outreach Specialist, Washington Oﬃ   ce of the Secretary 
of StateStatement: Lucy leads a successful statewide Voter Education and 
Outreach program focused in underserved communities. Her lived experiences include: small business owner, property owner, and landlord. Her true passion is public service.
Education : Seattle must continue to invest in the education of our 
children. The future of our nation lies in the education they receive 
today. She will prioritize civics education. Also, mental health therapy should be normalized to remove ableism and stigma.
Aﬀ  ordable housing : Census reports indicate Seattle’s population is 
still growing. Seattle continues to face this crisis and Lucy is ready 
to engage with stakeholders to strategically seek and use allocated resources and streamline city services. 
Homelessness : Seattle is getting federal funding and Lucy is ready to 
support viable programs to address root causes for homelessness in 
our diverse communities. Seattle must spend responsibly and invest in self-sustainable programs. She is ready to partner-up to build an eﬀ  ective  revitalization downtown program for Pioneer Square and 
beyond.
Transportation : Lucy supports development without displacement
, longer 
tunnels please! Elevated concrete bridges continue to fail: WS bridge, 
99 Alaskan Way viaduct (1950-2013), and recently NB-HWY 99. She wants to avoid another “ Seattle Monorail Failure”! Sound Transit came 
to a halt with the main corridor. Stakeholders in CID, Ballard, and WS have not bought-in, but ST is pushing hard to start building the WS extension.
The ST measure passed in 2016 with 57% in King and 51% in 
Snohomish, but failed in Pierce County. The property taxes and car tab 
increases hurt our most vulnerable communities. Stop displacements 
and save green spaces! It’s time to place this measure back on the 2024 
ballot. Voters must decide to keep this going for 13+ years or seek a leaner project. Visit her website for more information. Please vote for Lucy as your councilwoman, District 1!

Political Science
Occupation: Attorney, Former Appointed Member of Seattle Police 
Chief Search CommitteeStatement: I am running to serve the people of District 1 with their 
best interests in mind ﬁ  rst. We need an accountable, responsive 
government willing to center equity, progressive values, and common sense.
My name is Rob Saka and I’d be honored  to serve you. I am a public 
school dad of three, attorney, public safety advocate, and Air Force Veteran. I am the proud son of a Nigerian immigrant and former 
warehouse worker who rescued me from foster care and raised me as 
a single father. 
I believe in safe communities and better policing. Everyone has a right 
to feel safe in their neighborhood, free of crime or unequal justice. We must enact Both eﬀ  ective prevention strategies And appropriate 
response capabilities to meet the realities of today’s public safety challenges.
While growing up, I lived in public and low-income housing. These 
experiences taught me that everyone deserves safe, quality aﬀ  ordable 
housing in a thriving community. A severe lack of housing for people 
at all income levels means that those at the bottom are suﬀ  ering the most. We must build more aﬀ  ordable housing, particularly low-income housing and workforce housing for middle income residents.
As a former foster kid, I know what it’s like to be completely uprooted 
and swept away. We must do better for our unhoused neighbors. Sadly, the homelessness crisis in our city has devolved into a total humanitarian catastrophe. It is our moral imperative to take urgent action and ﬁ  nd people housing and treatment now.
At City Hall, I want to normalize collaborating across diﬀ  erences, 
ﬁ  nding common ground, and getting bold things accomplished that work for everyone. I know there is a better way forward for Seattle, and I couldn’t be more energized at the opportunity we have to do it together!

Occupation: Jean Iannelli Craciun Research; Founder Diversity Center 
of Washington; SociologistStatement: I am grateful for the opportunity to serve our District 1 
community (West Seattle, SouthPark, Highland Park, Georgetown, Soho, Delridge, Pioneer Square). 
I grew up the youngest of ﬁ  ve children in Cleveland, Ohio above my 
family’s funeral home. It was there that my elders modeled loving kindness to people in crisis. This was formative in my development as a compassionate person and sociologist. 
I moved to Seattle from Alaska in 2006, continuing to conduct 
research globally, nationally and locally in Washington. In 2018, I founded The Diversity Center of Seattle Washington, working to 
advance diversity, equity and inclusion by driving authentic innovation 
for change in our workplaces and communities. I am a strong West Seattle community member and determined advocate for the rich multi-cultural communities here. 
I am the only candidate in D1 with the knowledge and experience 
of a 30-year researcher, small businessowner, entrepreneur, public school parent, and renter with a lifelong commitment to community engagement. I am a feminist, a proud member of the LGBTQIA2s+ community, breast cancer survivor, and loving Italian Mama to 8 children in our blended family. 
We need all of us participating to solve the complex problems we face 
in our post-pandemic society, including: public safety concerns in our neighborhoods; income inequality; greater aﬀ  ordability in housing; business growth and development; parental leave and addressing the childcare crisis; reimagining transportation corridors to support amenities and work; and equality of opportunity realized in the promise of liberty and justice for all.
As a councilmember, I will lead with unwavering commitment to 
District 1 where everyone is engaged, respected, and valued. I will listen and act on your behalf and we will, together, get things moving toward a safer, more vibrant Seattle. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and the honor of your vote.

Education: B.A. in English & Women Studies; post-grad certiﬁ  cate in 
User-Centered Design, UW
Occupation: Senior Leader in Tech and Mom
Statement: At some point, we all have the choice to put others ﬁ  rst. 
In 2020, Amazon put warehouse workers in unsafe conditions and was failing to act on climate change. As a dedicated employee and mom, I wanted Amazon to do better, and I wanted to show my kids the importance of doing what’s right. I put my career on the line and led thousands of my coworkers to take an unprecedented stand. I 
outlined a plan to win, did the work, and delivered results. Our actions 
led to Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Bezos’s $10 billion Earth Fund, and increased worker safety. 
Now I want to help District 1 and Seattle rise to the challenges of our 
times. We must make rapid, meaningful progress on public safety, homelessness, aﬀ  ordable housing, and climate change. There are more unsheltered people on our streets than ever. Immediately, we need to increase stable permanent housing and coordinate with regional partners to ensure that those experiencing homelessness have paths to necessary resources. 
We need to feel safe in our neighborhoods and parks. We can have 
police and alternative responses; lead with compassion and refuse 
to tolerate harmful behavior; and tackle poverty, mental illness, and 
addiction so that crime decreases. I will be a strong advocate for bringing response times down, while ending racial bias and excessive force.
Climate change is here and our city isn’t ready. With new federal 
funding, I will help lead our city to reduce emissions and protect residents from heatwaves, smoke, and ﬂ  ooding. 
My vision for Seattle is to establish holistic public safety, end 
homelessness, and lead the world into the new green economy. Together we can build a safe, equitable, sustainable city for all. I hope to earn your vote.

Emergency Services CenterStatement: As the only
 candidate who has worked in behavioral health 
and housing programs in our city, I have the experience to reverse the 
epidemic of overdose deaths and house the homeless. My candidacy 
represents an opportunity to get Seattle back on track, making it a safe and thriving city for all. 
Throughout my life I have deliberately chosen to work in the helping 
profession—ﬁ  rst as a combat medic in the US Army, and for the last decade as a clinical social worker helping our most vulnerable and building programs that address mental health, addiction, and homelessness. 
We will create a dynamic and robust response to help people in crisis 
with clinicians trained to provide critical behavioral health support. 
With an adequately staﬀ  ed police department and a team of clinicians 
providing crisis interventions, we can eliminate the concentration of criminal activity in parts of the city where it has become problematic. 
I will champion aﬀ  ordable housing solutions that keep working 
families in our city, improving the quality of life for all. I’ll be a voice for 
local businesses, improving our economic recovery. I’ll address West 
Seattle’s mobility needs with roadway investments, pedestrian safety, and clean transit alternatives. As an active Seattle Public Schools volunteer, I’m passionate about the health and future for our kids– from gun violence prevention to immediate climate action.
The standard to help others had been shaped by the example of 
my grandmother who demonstrated the virtue of selﬂ  essness and humility during her lifetime as she cared for many people in profound 
need and left the world a better place because of her courage. I intend 
to lead with that same courage.
I’m a proud union member endorsed by transit operators, building

Education: BA in Physics and Science, Technology and Society, Vassar 
College; JD Cardozo School of Law
Occupation: Administrative Law Judge, Washington Oﬃ   ce of 
Administrative HearingsStatement: My name is Phil Tavel. I’m running for one simple reason: 
Seattle City Council is failing to deliver on its basic promises.
The last few years have been discouraging. City Council has spent 
countless millions on our homelessness crisis. Despite that, hundreds of our unhoused neighbors have died, and our parks and public spaces have deteriorated. Meanwhile, City Council has failed to even deliver a contract to fully fund basic police services. It’s unacceptable. 
Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable in their neighborhood. 
Like you, I want a Seattle that keeps its promises. That should start with the City Council.
I’ll bring unmatched experience on these issues to the Council. My 
service includes being an Administrative Law Judge, Public Defender and community leader. Every day in my hearings I learn about our neighbors’ struggles. From property crime to gun violence to aﬀ  ordability issues, I understand our toughest community challenges. In my volunteer work, I try to solve those challenges by bringing people together to ﬁ  nd common ground and by focusing on 
measurable progress. I successfully organized thousands of neighbors to push for results on the West Seattle Bridge. On City Council, I’ll work 
just as hard for you.
We all know what matters. Seattle should be safe, clean, and 
prosperous. We should invest in both unarmed crisis responders and police staﬃ   ng. We should support emergency shelters and safe lots, while restoring our parks and public spaces. We should stop making Seattle a tough place to open a business, or even get permits. We need leaders who get it.
I want to restore pride in Seattle. It will take a City Council that works 
hard and focuses on what works and what matters most. It’s time for public service, not politics. I’m Phil Tavel, and I ask for your vote.

Occupation: Longshoreman/Dockworker
Statement: My name is Mia Jacobson. I am 35 years old, a third 
generation West Seattleite, a third generation union longshoreman, and a single mother of three. I was born in the house that I’m raising kids in, which means I’ve watched District 1 change over my lifetime and I am invested in its future. This is my community. This is my children’s community. I want this community to sustain in these radically changing times. 
I spent nearly 5 years attempting to enter into the local legislative 
process as a private citizen and found it systematically impossible to do so. This led me to recognize the inadequacy of our current process when trying to best address our issues. My experience growing up in a union family has shown me the impact that a culture of solidarity, democracy, and community organization can have when negotiating relationships of power and creating policy that eﬀ  ectively serves the collective.
My campaign is rooted in systemic change so that we can better 
address the problems we face in our community. If elected, I will work to improve citizen access to the legislative process, to introduce transparency and accountability within our system of local governance, and to celebrate community organization and empowerment. 
I believe that we have outgrown the system of representation as 
we collectively step into a new era of being human. Our current 
technological advancement has created a fundamentally diﬀ  erent kind 
of citizen. We now have access to the information needed to become a valuable contributor to the conversation which creates legislation. We can coordinate within large numbers in a digital space to discuss our local policies 24 hours a day. It is time to shift our focus from the powers that be - to the powers that we have become.

Occupation: Business Owner, Community Advocate
Statement: I grew up in Beacon Hill, work at my family business in 
the Chinatown International District and now live in Rainier Beach. I’ve seen how South Seattle has changed, I’ve seen what happens to neighborhoods that don’t have a voice and are expected to live with bad city policies. I want to change that.
As a community advocate, I’ve fought against continued discrimination 
from the city towards the CID, recently named one of the most endangered neighborhoods in America. I learned that ﬁ  ghting for our voice when the city imposes their will without listening to our 
community, is a ﬁ  ght we can win. I want to bring that same passion to 
ﬁ  ght for all of South Seattle.
I know how to achieve better public safety. Every week, I practice what 
alternative policing looks like with my community watch group that prevents violence while working with ﬁ  rst responders when needed, and provides mutual aid to the unhoused in the CID. 
I know how to create more aﬀ  ordable housing. My family renovated 
the historic Louisa Hotel into workforce housing which only charges residents a percentage of their income so nobody is charged rent 
they cannot aﬀ  ord. This model can be used to ﬁ  ght displacement and 
gentriﬁ  cation across South Seattle.
We need to move past elected leaders telling us what they’re going to 
do, but never showing up to hear what people really want. We need leaders that listen to the community even when it’s not politically convenient, and do the hard work it takes to run Seattle. Together we can uplift South Seattle to be the place we know it can be.  I promise to show up, work hard and help make Seattle better, together.

Occupation: Current Seattle City Councilmember, former Rainier 
Beach Action Coalition organizerStatement: It’s been an honor to serve as your Councilmember, and 
I’m running again so that, together, we can continue building a future that includes all of us. I’ve got the experience to organize community-centered approaches and I secure the investments to match. We deliver on our values rather than simply profess them.
My oﬃ   ce has a proven track record of progressive action. We 
committed to investing in historically under-funded schools, so we funded mental health in Southend schools. We said we’d prevent displacement, so we won tenant protections, monumental worker protections like paid sick leave for gig workers, and secured rent control for our small businesses. I secured permanent funding for community-driven development, and for the Green New Deal. All this 
and more in diﬃ   cult times.
Let’s advance these wins even further. I envision housing abundance 
and vibrant small businesses within reach of all generations who 
stay rooted in their community. Children with full stomachs and single mothers with full wallets. Community networks preventing violence rather than just reacting to it. We’ve only just begun building 
alternatives to punishment and incarceration—especially for our Black 
and brown neighbors who suﬀ  er from the paradox of over-policing and under-policing.
Let’s deepen our investments in care and shared prosperity. We all 
deserve to feel safe in our neighborhoods. As a mom with 2 kids in Seattle Public Schools, it’s important to me that all our children are safe whether they’re walking to school or enjoying the park. We’ve only begun that work by investing in the resources District 2 needs to improve our community health, joy, and safety.
Thank you for getting me here; I hope to continue serving D2’s vibrant 
communities.

Education: University of Kentucky - Information Science
Occupation: Co-Chair of the Green Party of the United States
Statement: My name is Margaret Elisabeth and I’m running for Seattle 
City Council in District 2.
I ﬁ  rst visited Seattle during June of 1999 and fell in love with the city. 
I vividly remember sitting in a coﬀ  ee shop in Kirkland looking South towards Mt. Rainier – the sky an impossible blue where you can see for miles and Mt. Rainier took my breath away. I moved to Seattle in 2012, into the Belltown neighborhood, where I lived for 5 years. In 2017 I moved to Rainier Beach where I’ve lived ever since. 
We have a lot of serious issues facing us as citizens of Seattle and I’d 
like to mention three things we need to directly address: Universal 
Citywide Single Payer Healthcare, The Right to Shelter and a Real Living Wage.
Healthcare is a right and we need to enact legislation to make this 
right a reality. Following the models of Healthy San Francisco and NYC Health+Hospitals, the City of Seattle should establish a universal healthcare access program to ensure all residents receive free, at point of service, healthcare without relying on employer-sponsored plans or private insurance.
The City of Seattle should establish rent control and renter’s rights, 
end exclusive single-family zoning, ban new AirBNB developments, establish high-density, mixed incoming housing near transit centers, and the City should expand cooperative housing, expand social housing and make it easier to enter and sustain home-ownership for Seattle residents.
The City of Seattle should adopt a $25/hr true living wage which is 
automatically adjusted based on the cost of healthcare, housing, food, transportation and inﬂ  ation. I’m running for Seattle City Council in District 2 because I believe we can change our city if we take bold action now. Vote for me in District 2 for an Evergreen future.

Education: Bachelors in Philosophy, UNLV; Juris Doctorate, Seattle 
University School of Law (magna cum laude)
Occupation: Public Defender, Pierce County Department of Assigned 
CounselStatement: I want to live in a Seattle where the government is 
accountable to the community, especially when it comes to keeping 
the community accountable.  Over the last few years, particularly since 
the CHOP, I have been frustrated by our city government’s abdication of their responsibilities.  Seattle has been increasingly covered in 
graﬃ   ti and inundated by property crime while a toxic compassion has 
taught us to walk past and otherwise ignore our neighbors’ suﬀ  ering as they kill themselves with fentanyl and other drugs.   We can do 
better.
For the last 12 years I’ve worked as a public defender, representing 
some of the poorest and most marginalized among us. Many of my clients were chronically homeless, suﬀ  ering from substance use disorders as well as co-occurring mental illnesses. I know it’s possible to treat people with respect while still expecting responsibility.
My experience with mental illness isn’t just professional, but also 
personal.  In 2015, I was confronted with a diﬃ   cult diagnosis at 30 years old.  It shattered my identity, and the stigma inspired suicidal thoughts. Fortunately, I found a supportive community and the right combination of medications, and I’ve been stable now for six years.  I’m sharing this for two reasons: to confront the stigma, but also, because I recognize we need to be accountable for our own mental health. 
If elected I will work to reconcile the trust gap between the community and SPD.  We need more oﬃ   cers out of cars and patrolling streets on 
foot and by bike. I will provide housing subsidies to both help attract new oﬃ   cers and make sure more of our oﬃ   cers are patrolling the streets of the communities they live in . We will prioritize community 
safety, not just oﬃ   cer safety.
I promise to stay accountable and accessible, and to prioritize ideas 
that are practical and actionable.

Occupation: Seattle Public Schools Substitute Teacher, 37th 
Democrats 1st Vice ChairStatement: Our city is at a turning point. We haven’t had leadership 
that listens. We aren’t able to trust that our elected oﬃ   cials will do a good job. We’ve been hindered by political games, inﬂ  exibility, indecisiveness, and special interest money. We can’t aﬀ  ord more of the same.
I decided to run the day my son was born. I need him to grow up 
in a place where leaders behave like leaders and respond to their neighbors when they are called upon. In my role as a husband, father, business owner, care provider, activist, and substitute teacher I’ve 
learned that the most important piece of our lives is how we can be of 
service to our community.
I would like to serve because we need one million square feet of 
“home” for our homeless neighbors within the next three years. Allowing for temporary sanctioned encampments for those unready to come inside, ending the practice of sweeps, and adding wrap-
around services will allow people build self-suﬃ   cient lives of meaning. 
Additionally, we’re going to reinstate the free ride zone so that Seattle becomes a leader on public transit opportunities for people nationwide.
Immediately, we need to leave the war on drugs behind and invest in 
education, support services, and job training. I will work to create a jobs pipeline into new public safety models for formerly incarcerated persons so that those with lived experience can be the next case workers, crisis responders, and more.

work, direct conversations, and building solutions. I’m the only

Occupation: Ex- Senior Program Manager, Microsoft, PMP; Actor; 
CashierStatement: 
I am a ﬁ  rst-generation gay immigrant from India and have 
lived in Seattle since 2002. From working as a program manager at 
Microsoft to pursuing the dream as an actor to working retail, I have experienced the struggles of work at every level. I am also a member of the SAG-AFTRA union.
I have served on my condo HOA board for ﬁ  ve years. This role has 
enabled me to listen to my constituents, be empathetic to their problems and focus on ﬁ  nding and implementing solutions.   
I get the job done!
My platform prioritizes advancing green infrastructure across the city. 
This includes expanding Sound Transit with last mile loop buses. I will also work with Seattle City Light to expand electric infrastructure. This will enable the expansion of electric cars throughout the city. The green energy industry should provide opportunities for local businesses, and I especially want to support businesses owned by women, people of color and sexual minorities.
I want to make housing more aﬀ  ordable by de-zoning, leveraging 
I-135 and reducing competition from non-resident investors. I believe in compassionate solutions for homelessness. I believe in enhancing public safety by hiring local Seattleites for our police and ﬁ  re departments while ensuring equal opportunity for all historically excluded communities.
I support reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, and worker rights 
to organize. I want to streamline the process and resolve local constituent concerns like potholes and damaged pavements in a timely manner. I am in this race because I want to build a more prosperous and equitable Seattle.

Occupation: Customer Success Partner, TheGuarantors; Artist & 
Producer with RYCO TheatricalsStatement: I am running to be the ﬁ  rst non-binary Councilmember 
on the Seattle City Council to represent our historic Arts District, the diverse LGBTQ+ community, and all constituents in District 3. Our campaign is building momentum to keep Seattle as progressive as we can with a focus on shelter, safety, and sustainability .
Together, we will establish a universal “right-to-shelter,” pass robust renter protections and rent control, work to reform our strained 
policing system (in partnership with the BIPOC community) in building 
speciﬁ  c alternatives to those more traditional response models, and create America’s ﬁ  rst carbon free city by 2030. I believe that we get more done for the city and its residents when we put aside divisive rhetoric and work together toward a common goal. Inspired by the 
work of Senator Sanders, I identify as a pragmatic Democratic Socialist 
and believe that I’m the most progressive candidate running for this seat. Furthermore, as a lifetime Sierra Club member and activist with Extinction Rebellion, Seattle will never see a stronger advocate for protecting our environment and battling the impacts of climate change. 
As a third-generation union worker and member of two locals, I am 
deeply committed to go beyond business-as-usual and ﬁ  ght as a warrior for the labor movement and the working people of Seattle. We can do more to lift up wages and worker protections while also 
focusing on economic recovery. These are the values I will bring to the 
Council when elected. 
Our campaign is proudly endorsed by the King County Young 
Democrats, the Seattle Green Party, and the Green Party of Washington. I’m honored that our race has the backing of these groups and so many others. It would be a great privilege to earn your vote and support throughout our people-oriented campaign to create actionable change in our community.

Statement: I am a pragmatic uniter who believes in standing up 
for what’s right, with empathy and accountability. I believe in building together through community-centric relationships; my lived experiences continue to inform me on how this translates into 
meaningful policy. As one formerly unhoused and who lives and works 
alongside those who face the same struggles - especially when it comes to housing aﬀ  ordability, availability, and accessibility. I will use this oﬃ   ce to fund the mandate for social housing by Seattle voters.
As a Black man from a Nigerian immigrant background,  community 
safety means that we all must feel safe, including that we must ﬁ  nd alternatives to policing that are evidence-based and rooted in community responsibility and resilience. We cannot keep doing the same old things and hoping for diﬀ  erent outcomes; this is not only ﬁ  scally irresponsible, it is morally harmful. Seattle can and must do better.
I am HIV-positive, and I have been ﬁ  ghting for digniﬁ  ed healthcare 
and health equity as a professional and an activist.. I am an LGBTQ+ individual who is active in LGBTQ+ rights, especially for BIPOC individuals. As such I am a lifelong advocate for the safety and sense of belonging that we all inherently deserve.
I rely on public transit and walking; I know how important it is to 
expand safe and accessible multimodal transportation and build safe walkways and bike lanes.
I march, and I also walk the walk. I am the chair of the Washington 
State Stonewall Democrats, co-chair of the Seattle LGBTQ Commission, and Board Member for People Of Color Against AIDS Network (POCAAN) and Seattle LGBTQ+ Center. I hope to earn your vote to serve you as District 3’s next City Councilmember.

prioritize:
Community safety rooted in upstream solutions that reduce crime,

Aﬀ  ordable housing  for all income levels, from students and young 
families to seniors, including the expansion of emergency shelter and 
permanent supportive housing. I’ll promote density, address impacts 
of displacement and gentriﬁ  cation, and provide opportunities for ﬁ  rst-
time homebuyers and family housing options. 
Healthy communities  for current neighbors and future generations with 
thriving local businesses that anchor our neighborhoods and create 
jobs; where aﬀ  ordable childcare and wraparound services, parks, 
playﬁ  elds, libraries, roads, and open space are within reach, and there 
are safe and accessible ways to get around.  
My family of public school educators, public servants, and civil rights 
leaders have made positive change in Seattle for generations. Inspired 
by them, I’ve dedicated my life to public service and driving equitable 
policy at every level. I will be a bridge for our community to city hall

University School of Law
Occupation: Attorney
Statement: With at least four new faces coming to Seattle City Council 
we have a unique opportunity to enact real, lasting solutions to the 
housing aﬀ  ordability, homelessness, and climate crises. I am uniquely 
qualiﬁ  ed to serve during this critical time in our city’s history. I was born during the height of Reaganomics and my family struggled 
ﬁ  nancially throughout my childhood. I would not be here today without sacriﬁ  ce, community, and the occasional second chance. My early struggles are why I’m drawn to serve in the public sector, previously as part of the uniformed services, and currently, as an attorney in Mental Health Court. 
We’re living at an inﬂ  ection point: the culmination of generations 
of deliberate disenfranchisement along racial lines exacerbating divisions in our country, and underinvestment in social services. Our task is not a simple one, we must invest in non-police responses for crisis intervention while also taking an aggressive stance on removing guns from our streets all while prioritizing rehabilitation for low level oﬀ  enders to break the cycle. 
Simultaneously, we Must greatly expand our supply of aﬀ  ordable 
housing; maximize usage of existing inventory; minimize displacement 
of vulnerable communities; and ensure accessible transit for all. To 
this end, I’m committed to leveraging our social housing developer and creating 200K homes over the next ten years–anything less and we’ll only see the aﬀ  ordability crisis worsen. 
For Seattle to be successful, we must acknowledge there’s no going 
back to “how things were before.” We must take action to build a Seattle we can all be proud to pass on to the next generation. We must decarbonize our transportation system, invest in bold capital projects to redeﬁ  ne our city and improve quality of life. I believe we have it within us to realize this vision, and be an example for other cities to follow.

common ground, solving problems, and delivering results. Alongside community, I’ve created lasting, positive changes in housing and transit, reforming enforcement and improving neighborhoods.
For ﬁ  ve years, I led First Hill’s neighborhood association, where we 
welcomed aﬀ  ordable housing, built safer transportation, better parks, 
and increased livability. Until recently, I was the Executive Director of 
Transportation Choices Coalition, where I built coalitions that secured transformative transportation investments, expanded light rail and bus service, and made transit free for youth.
Our district has beautiful, vibrant places. We lead with compassion. 
But things are oﬀ   track, and too many of us fall through the cracks. We must urgently address complicated problems like homelessness, public safety, and aﬀ  ordability.
With fresh ideas, courage, and a commitment to action, we can build 
more housing, care for our vulnerable neighbors, and keep everyone safe. We can be a great city. I understand District 3’s challenges - and how to make progress. On my website, I’ve released extensive policy agendas and am bringing bold solutions to the table.

I serve on the board of a major non-proﬁ  t aﬀ  ordable housing provider and the Freeway Park Association. I’m proud to be endorsed by labor unions, progressive organizations, and community leaders.
We deserve a representative committed to listening, problem-solving, 
and making our lives better. My years of experience shows I can hit the ground running and get Seattle on track to reach our full potential together. It’d be an honor to serve our district, and I’m asking for your vote.

Education: BSCE with distinction and Mathematics Minor, Nevada; MS, 
Civil Engineering, UW; Project Mgmt Cert, UW
Occupation: Engineer/Owner, Integrity Structural Engineering, PLLC
Statement: City Council has failed to eﬀ  ectively address 
homelessness, public safety, and housing unaﬀ  ordability.  It’s time to replace mismanagement and deliver safe neighborhoods, well-maintained parks, roads, greenways, and public transportation that beneﬁ  t all residents.  Our city is facing a homelessness and addiction crisis.  As one with close family who’ve struggled with addiction and homelessness for decades, I’ve seen ﬁ  rsthand the impacts.  I’m running to bring back pragmatic policies and a renewed focus on delivering the basics.
As a business owner and civil engineer with 31 years of experience 
building major infrastructure and public works, I have the know-how to ensure growth beneﬁ  ts all. Smart planning can improve livability, protect the environment and tree canopy, increase quality of life, and prevent many of the problems we face today due to shortsightedness.  I will work to safeguard growth that provides aﬀ  ordable housing for all stages and ages, and beneﬁ  ts neighborhoods without overstressing existing infrastructure.
On Council, I’ll be your advocate for public safety, restoring police 
staﬃ   ng to needed levels, and will make decisions that improve Seattle’s livability.  I’ll work to improve 911 response times, uplift and support our local businesses, and reestablish accountability in City Hall. With the right leadership, we can restore Downtown and the neighborhood business districts we are proud of.
Seattle is a world-class city and deserves a councilmember who 
understands public works, supports local businesses, protects parks and schools, funds police and emergency responders, and acts to address homelessness eﬀ  ectively, compassionately, and immediately.  You have my pledge: I will be that Councilmember. I ask for your vote.

Occupation: Entrepreneur, startup consultant, husband, father
Statement: I’m a dad, entrepreneur, and community advocate. A 
longtime Seattle resident, I’ve watched politicians put rhetoric over results as countless people have paid the price. I’ve got a serious plan to ﬁ  x it and build the ambitious future we deserve.
I didn’t start life in a place like Roosevelt. I’m the product of a teen 
pregnancy, but my parents eventually managed to buy a house and 
build us a beautiful life. I got really lucky, graduated from Harvard Law 
School, launched a tech company, and have been a business leader since. Journeys like mine are impossible in Seattle today.
Seattle should be a place where people from any background can 
aﬀ  ord to raise a family, build a career, and age in place. I’ll work 
tirelessly to deliver an aﬀ  ordable city that leaves no one on the street. I’ll ﬁ  ght to make it as easy to get around without a car as it is with one, 
leading on livability and climate. 
As a parent, I won’t stop until Seattle is safe for everyone. I’m the 
only candidate with a serious plan: to stop crime before it starts with evidence-based prevention, to quickly send the right professional for each emergency, and to rebuild trust in law enforcement through good governance and accountability.
To build tomorrow’s economy, I’ll double down on our existing 
and emerging strengths, and expand apprenticeships. We’ll attract tomorrow’s workforce with housing and childcare they can aﬀ  ord in 
neighborhoods they want. I’m the only candidate with a plan to build a 
fairer tax code.
I’m proud to be endorsed by unions, climate leaders, the local 
Democrats, business leaders, and current and former electeds like King County Councilmembers Girmay Zahilay and Larry Gosset, Port Commissioners Toshiko Hawegawa, Sam Cho and Ryan Calkins, and many more. I’d be honored by your support.

Council District No. 4
Education: Master Science, Information Systems University of 
Washington Bachelor Arts, Business Administration University of 
Washington
Occupation: AmeriCorps VetCorps Member, Washington State 
Department of Veterans Aﬀ  airsStatement: Hello! My name is George Artem, and I am running for 
Seattle City Council District 4.
I came to the United States as a child from the ex-Soviet Union and 
the greater Seattle area has been my home for over three decades. I attended the University of Washington as an undergrad and completed a Master of Science in Information Systems from the same institution ten years later.
My interest in politics began after the devastation of the second Bush 
administration. In 2008 I canvassed for President Barack Obama, and in 2016 I caucused with Democrats for Senator Bernie Sanders and later supported Dr. Jill Stein in the general election. I stayed out of the 2020 election cycle; but as I’ve gotten older and went to law school, I have found myself agreeing with more of what Washington State 
Republicans have to say and aligning with moderate conservatives like 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. However, in truth I’m a pragmatist that prefers solutions over parties.
When I returned from law school, the city that I love had become 
unrecognizable. Previously bustling commercial districts had turned into open air drug markets, and tents lined the downtown streets. My 
primary motivation for running was to take action on drug possession, change our politics around policing, make rent aﬀ  ordable, and cut red 
tape and permitting costs so that Seattle can build.
I believe in small government and local control. As a City Council 
member, I intend to use those as guiding principles to push back against Olympia’s one-size-ﬁ  ts-all policies and bring a culture of 
accountability to local government. Whether it be the City, the County, 
or the State, our leaders have raised and spent a lot of money in recent years, and the public has a right to know where it went.

Occupation: Deputy Director, Oﬃ   ce of Arts & Culture, City of Seattle
Statement: I’ll never forget waiting and worrying outside Ingraham 
High School as my teenage girls were in lockdown during the recent school shooting. It really brought home that things are oﬀ   track. I grew up in a tough neighborhood in the Bronx on the top ﬂ  oor of a ﬁ  ve story walk up. My dad was a welder and proud union member, my mom worked in a factory. They moved from Puerto Rico seeking a better life.
I found that life here in Seattle.  Unfortunately due to poor decisions 
and performative posturing by the City Council -- including pledging to 
defund the police -- our quality of life has eroded, neighborhood small 
businesses are struggling and our streets are less safe.  I’ll listen and 
work to end the divisiveness and put Seattle back on track.
I’ll make public safety my top priority.  Five-minute response times 
for priority 911 calls, get guns oﬀ   our streets, shut down open-air drug markets, address addiction and the mental health crisis. It’s also unacceptable that three years after the murder of George Floyd, Seattle still has no alternative to an armed response to 911 calls. Not all situations require police oﬃ   cers, but many do. I’ll prioritize. I will bring people together to build more aﬀ  ordable housing and address the homelessness crisis.  
With more than 30 years in public service, I know how to get things 
done. I worked in the White House as President Clinton’s Hispanic 
liaison, for the National Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in Seattle for 
the ACLU post 9/11 to protect Muslim communities from xenophobia, and for former Councilmember Tom Rasmussen. I am honored to have the endorsements of Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Former Councilmember Tom Rasmussen, and many others.
With better governance, Seattle can be progressive, safe, and vibrant. 
I ask for your support.

If elected, I will assure that city government centers and ampliﬁ  es the needs and voices of the community. Together, we’ll make sure Seattle works better for All people in our city.
From direct social and housing service work to social equity and policy advocacy consulting, I’ve advocated alongside hundreds of community

To ﬁ  nd sustainable solutions to persistent problems, we must 
start with policies and systems as root causes of inequity. We must enact pragmatic policies for sustainable solutions for accessible and aﬀ  ordable housing, increased wage parity, and improved working conditions for working families; Achieving multiple pathways toward shared goals around community safety; Improved multimodal transportation systems focused on pedestrian safety; Small business support focused on economic recovery and growth; Fixing infrastructure gaps throughout our city; Disability Justice and Intersectional Civic Empowerment.
My policy change background includes co-organizing the passage 
of one of the nation’s ﬁ  rst bans of sub-minimum wage; successfully advocating for the adoption of Disability Justice principles at the Seattle Oﬃ   ce of Civil Rights; co-organizing the ﬁ  ght for rent control, resulting in the six-month advance notice legislation passed by the council; and endorsing the Jumpstart Tax as a small business owner.

Statement: District 5 deserves more.
When I moved to North Seattle in 2001, I found a welcoming 
community and an engaged local business culture. I had ample opportunities to meet neighbors and cultivate a sense of belonging. For decades I have watched North Seattle ﬁ  ll with big box stores and chain restaurants that smother our small businesses, drive down our wages and don’t invest in our local communities.
We deserve housing and economic opportunities here in District 5. 
I will tirelessly advocate for development around our new transit stations and major roads, because density is responsible ﬁ  scal policy. I see North Seattle playing a pivotal role in our city’s expansion by 
modeling responsible housing density. We will create homes and jobs, 
all while minimizing the displacement of our neighbors.
We deserve to live where we work. With my experience in real estate, I 
will be in close collaboration with the newly-developed social housing authority to create stability and security in Seattle’s cost of housing. No one who works in Seattle should have to worry about their cost of living outpacing their income. Properly funded social housing is an important tool for addressing our out-of-control housing and rental prices. 
We deserve to feel protected and respected when we call the city 
in need. Every day I support social and mental health workers in aiding those who rely on our systems for support, and I will bring this compassion and advocacy to the city council to develop a civic response force that will alleviate the unnecessary harm that can manifest from police response. It is expensive, harmful, and unjust to continue our current cycle of incarceration for people whose only crime is being poor. Seattle’s civil servants should show up when called and respond appropriately.

Education: Two decades in union and social struggles.
Occupation: Railway switchman
Statement: The Socialist Workers Party stands for independent 
working-class political action. Deteriorating conditions confronting 
working people in Seattle are produced by the bosses as they squeeze 
ever more out of workers and farmers.
After decades of attacks on our wages and working conditions, today 
there is a wind at the backs of workers who sense more opportunities to ﬁ  ght back. More workers and unionists are bringing to bear the class solidarity needed to eﬀ  ectively resist the accelerated speedup, longer hours, attacks on job safety, inﬂ  ation-battered wages, lack of steady work, confronting the social and moral blight produced by world capitalism’s proﬁ  t-driven crises of production and trade.
The heart of U.S. politics today is the ﬁ  ght to defend constitutional 
freedoms won in struggle. Illegal searches and seizures, violations of due process, legislation by courts, government spying, and curbs on freedom of speech, and more, will be used against the working class. Working people need those rights to defend ourselves. Every attack on them must be vigorously opposed, regardless of who the target is today.
Under the governance of the bosses’ parties what we win is soon 
taken away. When we depend on government to safeguard us, unelected bureaucracies, courts, and legislatures reverse our victories.
We need aﬀ  ordable housing, health care, drug rehabilitation and 
mental health care; decent jobs, training, and child care; time oﬀ   
work with our families, and control of safety and working conditions on the job.  We need a labor party based on the unions, to organize working people to stand together in our own class interests. This is not a scheme, but a revolutionary perspective for our class. In 1959 the workers and farmers of Cuba proved that those who are utterly 
discounted by the ruling classes can take power and change the world.

Occupation: Sr. IT Supervisor for Americas Region.
Statement: In 2013, The Lake City Community Center had been 
begging the city for months to install Wi-Fi, with delay after delay and no action. The community needed a solution so I volunteered, got on the roof, and installed the ﬁ  rst Wireless Internet system at the LCCC.
Sadly, a decade later nothing has changed. We watch volunteers take 
action and get results, while the programs City Hall pours millions into 
seem ineﬀ  ective. We have been patient and generous with our tax 
dollars, but we’re not getting our fair share or a fair say on spending. Accountability is my top priority. We need to enhance auditing of city expenditures, identify what is working and cut wasteful spending.
Having lived in north Seattle for almost 25 years, some of you know 
me from my prior business, The Computer Doctor. Some of you know me from my contributions at the Eagles Aerie #1. I’m proud to be an active participant in our community, contributing to making it better.
I believe IT Management principles can change City Hall. Examining 
problems and ﬁ  nding solutions (within budget) is what I do every day. 
I will make sure your voice is heard, because I will conduct a survey 
every 3 months and focus on what you want from city government.  
I also am a proud advocate of civil rights, and the right to choose. The 
anti-choice movement is based on two lies. The ﬁ  rst lie is every fetus is viable, the second lie is that pregnancy and birth don’t pose a life-threatening risk. In 2022, the US had the highest maternal mortality rate. Protecting civil rights is not enough. We have a moral obligation to audit and ensure our tax dollars are not feeding anti-choice organizations.

Statement: Like so many of you, I’m tired of the divisiveness that 
has taken root in Seattle politics that has not brought us the policy 
solutions we deserve. As a second-generation Iranian-American whose 
parents were granted political asylum, I know how fragile democracy can be. We need elected leaders who can focus on practical solutions and coalition building to address public safety, our housing crisis, and our transportation needs.
In 2019, my son and I heard a car crash and ran outside. We ran into 
a police oﬃ   cer telling us to run inside, as he went on to confront the Sand Point mass shooter only 20 feet away. I believe the police saved our lives that day. We are all tired of false choices when it comes to public safety. We should be able to keep our neighborhoods safe without blaming our unhoused neighbors as the root of our problems.
After the Parkland shootings, two moms and I organized to fundraise 
for and establish our nation’s largest gun buyback program. We need to continue our progress addressing our gun violence epidemic. 
I want 
to bring that passion, commitment, and proven collaborative working skills to Seattle City Council.
These issues are heightened by our climate crisis with ever hotter 
days and stiﬂ  ing wildﬁ  re smoke. Climate activists have chosen this 
campaign as the top climate platform out of all candidates citywide. In 
my platform, I bring solutions for our housing crisis, a greener transit system that includes sidewalks(!), funding for alternative policing models, and getting our unhoused population into homes.
Endorsed: 46th District Democrats, 32nd District Democrats, King 
County Young Democrats, United Food And Commercial Workers 3000, Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate, County Councilmember Rod Dembowski, Representative Julia Reed, Senator Javier Valdez, and more. I’d be honored to earn your vote.

Education: No education submitted.
Occupation: Student at North Seattle College
Statement: A college student and native of North Seattle, Lucca 
Murdoch Howard is deeply familiar with issues facing District Five. Aﬀ  ording rent, much less mortgage, is drifting out of reach for most residents. Seniors and students alike have to choose between moving out of city limits or facing tough choices. Basic problems are ignored in our bus network, making driving mandatory, and creating parking problems across the district. Aurora hasn’t been invested in for decades, being so decrepit that neighbors avoid it when it could be a business area and urban hub. Across North Seattle, communities are ignored by city hall--most District Five neighborhoods have no community center or voice in Seattle’s growth.
As Seattle’s youngest City Council member, Lucca will bring a 
fresh perspective for our district. He will listen to the community, and advocate for their solutions. Lucca worked on I-135, and will assure the Seattle Social Housing Developer is funded to relieve homelessness. Aurora should be a proper Main Street, by bringing bus, bike, and pedestrian infrastructure to places that don’t have them. 
Lucca’s main priorities are transit, aﬀ  ordable housing, and community 
improvements. He will prioritize community-based, sustainable solutions so that young people can start to thrive in Seattle.

Statement: I’m running for Seattle City Council because District 
5 deserves a proven pragmatic leader with experience in ﬁ  nding solutions and making sound decisions. As a twice elected Superior Court judge, public defender, legal services program manager, chair of the Seattle Human Rights Commission, Washington State Bar Association Governor, and Interim Seattle City Clerk, I understand the privilege and responsibility of making choices that impact people’s lives and livelihoods. 
As a North End neighbor, mom of Ingraham and Nathan Hale

I will draw upon my three decades of public service to deliver on the 
following priorities:
Public Safety:
 Timely police response and accountability, robust civilian 
responder program, proven gun violence interventions.  Housing: 
Dense and equitable development of the Aurora Corridor, 130th 
St Station area, Northgate, and Lake City. Support for Social Housing development across District 5.  Transit: Enhanced East/West bus 
service, ﬁ  rst mile/last mile transit service, needed sidewalks, bike lanes.  Community needs: Community center for Lake City and Haller Lake, on-demand behavioral health care, on-demand substance use treatment, hunger prevention and abatement programs, before-and-after school programs.  Economic opportunity: Support for local small 
business, particularly immigrant/minority/women owned.  Parks and 
Open Space: More parks and open space with equitable access.
The tasks ahead for our district and our city are formidable. With the 
right leadership – knowledgeable, experienced, courageous – they are achievable. If I have the honor of your vote for City Council, I will be transparent and accessible. I will lead with equitable and community-driven solutions, and most importantly, I will be accountable to you.

Occupation: Operations Director, Real Change News
Statement: My name is Tye Reed and I’m running to be your next 
District 5 councilmember.
Most people know me as the co-chair and co-founder of the House 
Our Neighbors coalition that won permanently aﬀ  ordable social housing in Seattle. I’m also a mutual aid organizer, a member of the Transit Riders Union, a board member for both Be: Seattle and the Housing Justice Project, as well as a displaced renter who is ready to represent your community on the Seattle City Council.
As your councilmember, I will immediately focus my oﬃ   ce’s attention on passing bold  progressive revenue to ﬁ  ll the projected $200 million 
shortfall in the 2024 budget. I will do this by increasing the Jumpstart tax on large corporations and implementing a capital gains wealth tax at the city level. Seattle residents are tired of regressive taxes that make every year harder and harder for working class families.
Seattle must stop these pointless sweeps. We know they don’t work 
and they never will. Last year, the City carried out over 900 sweeps, many of them at the same location multiple times, with only a 
worsening homeless crisis to show for it. Our tax dollars should not be 
wasted; we need more public bathrooms, trash pickup, and hygiene stations - not sweeps.
Finally, I will prioritize creating safe spaces for our kids, elders, and 
disabled neighbors through massive infrastructure investments. I will start by pedestrianizing Aurora with sidewalks, trees, and lit crosswalks. I will ﬁ  ght to make sure the 130th St station opens on schedule in 2026, with zoning that allows for dense, aﬀ  ordable housing in our district.
Community members have already told us what they need to live and 
thrive in a safe, healthy Seattle; politicians simply need to say yes. Vote 
Tye Reed to be your District 5 Councilmember.

Homeless Crisis; One only needs to walk our streets and in some

I will ensure that every dollar ensures a better future for Seattleites struggling out of poverty.

everyone in need. Rescue the weak and homeless from the powerful hands of heartless people” 
Fair and Good Paying Jobs; The unfair union busting actions we’ve

and be held to account. As your representative in City Council, I will 
work with trades and union organizers to ensure fair demands are met with Care.
Our Environment; As Your representative for district 5, I will ensure that our needs are being met as well to ensure cleaner parks for our kids to play in, upgraded equipment for them to enjoy, protected bike 
lanes for you to commute to work and tax dollars for businesses ready

Education: University of Virginia Law School (JD 1991); University of 
Virginia (BS Commerce 1983)
Occupation: Attorney, Shea Wilson, LLC
Statement: We’ve had enough performance art politics.  We need 
Change.  I ask for your vote to govern responsibly.  This campaign is about three hard issues:
Homelessness
 is now oﬃ   cially a long-term problem—at least ﬁ  ve years 
to address, according to the King County Regional Homelessness 
Authority.  Translation: encampments for ﬁ  ve more years at least.  Compassion is important.  But we need to identify who needs what kind of help by implementing three levels of designated urban 
campgrounds: sober; intermediate (cannabis/alcohol); and permissive 
(hard drugs Ok within the fenced and privacy-screened area). 
Public Safety is job one.  Our downtown, neighborhoods and parks cannot be no-go zones.  Seattle has fewer than 1000 police oﬃ   cers 
for about three-quarters of a million people, down from 1300 in 2017.  
We clearly need to add more commissioned oﬃ   cers and unarmed 
community service oﬃ   cers.  Enforce newly enacted laws against open 
hard drug use on our streets.
Social Justice  covers much ground, some beyond city-level government.  
We can address police-community relations.  Defunding the police is 
not the answer.  We must invest in best practices to ensure civilian safety.
And one ignored issue: Public Infrastructure .  Our bridges, water and 
sewer mains are aging.  The state legislature has now mandated 
6-plexes, which could triple or quadruple our population.  And we’ll have to foot the bill for the new infrastructure.
When you voted in 2019, were you voting to defund the police?  
Probably not.  New issues will emerge over the next four years.  I’ll 
take a socially liberal and ﬁ  scally conservative approach toward them.  
Leave people alone unless we need laws to keep their conduct from interfering with others.  Spend tax dollars amply but wisely.  Ability to pay matters.  Don’t overburden any one segment of the tax base.

Occupation: Working for the residents of District 6
Statement: I’m running for reelection because better is not good 
enough. Working with Mayor Harrell, I’ve worked to move homeless from parks and sidewalks to housing without sweeps, to make our communities safer, and to build more aﬀ  ordable housing. I work out of my District Oﬃ   ce and hold weekly oﬃ   ce hours to hear from you directly. We’ve seen progress, and we Must do better.
Public Safety: Yes, “defund the police” was a mistake. I’ve supported fully funding the Police staﬃ   ng and hiring plans every year, created a Public Safety Coordinator in Ballard, increased Harbor Patrol, and 
funded Mobile Crisis teams. Next term, I’ll continue fully funding police 
and working with Mayor Harrell to make policing better and safer.
Homelessness:  I resolved the Woodland Park and Ballard Commons 
encampments without sweeps, expanded outreach teams working 
with people living in cars, and created neighborhood-based homelessness response teams. We need to expand our eﬀ  orts to get homeless into housing, build and buy permanent housing, and push regional partners to act faster.
Housing:  I reformed the city’s processes to build housing faster and 
launched audits on our permitting process. I reduced the threat of 
eviction for tenants while ensuring landlords are made whole. We must increase the stock of family-size units so people of all income levels can aﬀ  ord it here.
Born and raised in District 6, I’m committed to our community’s 
success because I want to raise my kids in a neighborhood that is 
safer than the one I grew up in. I’ve dedicated my life to public service, 
serving with AmeriCorps and working to combat gun violence. Things 
are better, and better isn’t good enough. I ask for your vote to build on 
our success.

Education: Ballard High School graduate, 2 years at UW
Occupation: 22 years management in family manufacturing business

Statement: I intend to be a positive inﬂ  uence in District 6 and the 
entire City of Seattle.  I am a second-generation Seattle native.  My grandparents came here for the natural beauty and economic opportunity found in abundance in Seattle.
Elect me to be a moderate voice on our City Council.  My vision 
is to restore our city’s beauty and opportunity so my son and his generation can prosper and aﬀ  ord home ownership.  I am working to keep Seattle a safe and friendly place to raise a family.  I organized 
the successful cleanup of the Greenwood neighborhood as part of the 
One Seattle Day of Service.
I stepped up to a strong role in the community in April 2020 when 
the pandemic lockdown was extended.  Small businesses suﬀ  ered and individuals were denied necessary medical care.  I became increasingly concerned about the disregard for civil rights imposed by public health measures like the mask mandate and mandatory vaccination in workplaces and universities.  I became an advocate for 
medical freedom and helped dozens of workers ﬁ  nd accommodations 
to keep their jobs.  I was appalled to see so many good employees with legitimate medical and religious exemptions terminated unjustly.
It is largely due to my public presence and persistence that the COVID 
mandates ended in Washington state. Help me bring this boldness to our City Council to do what’s right.  Before we spend any more money on the homeless situation, we need accountability for money spent.  We must support the needs of business owners, homeowners, renters, and workers—Not add more to their tax burden.  We need to address our infrastructure—I would support the in-kind replacement of the Magnolia Bridge.  We need to restore public safety and police service so our businesses and families are safe.  Let’s Save Seattle together. Vote Victoria Palmer for District 6.

Occupation: Executive Director, Fremont Chamber of Commerce
Statement: With Mayor Harrell’s leadership, we’ve made some 
progress in making our neighborhoods safer, but there is still much work to be done. To achieve this, we must elect a pragmatic City Council committed to fulﬁ  lling its promises by focusing on the basics rather than engaging in divisive and performative politics. 
I bring a successful career in Hospitality spanning 35 years. I owned 
the Red Door in Fremont for two decades. Through this experience, I have honed my problem-solving skills and developed an ability to work within a budget.
My top priorities are:Community Safety: We must work with law enforcement, drug 
treatment experts, mental health professionals, and residents to ensure community safety. Our city should guarantee a timely and reliable response to ensure vibrant neighborhoods where we can all 
live, work, and play. Uniformed oﬃ   cers play an essential role, but not 
every situation requires their response.
Housing & Homelessness: Seattle must place the utmost importance 
on providing aﬀ  ordable housing to help working families, seniors 
and alleviate homelessness. To accomplish this, the city must direct its eﬀ  orts toward expanding the current housing supply and expediting permitting processes while maintaining aﬀ  ordability and neighborhood character. For those experiencing homelessness, we must increase shelter availability, implement programs like tiny home villages, and enhance mental health and drug treatment services. Our ultimate focus should be prioritizing support for those requiring it the most.
Seattle has been my beloved home for more than half a century. 
I strive to conduct myself with civility and compassion in all of my interactions. We are in a pivotal time as a city. I’m running because we need a more pragmatic, problem-solving approach to shape our shared future. I’d be honored to earn your vote.

Occupation: Retired
Statement: I am running because I am passionate about Seattle.  I 
moved here over 25 years ago when Seattle was rated the most livable 
city.in the country. Ask yourself if you can say that now? I have a vision 
of Seattle once again leading the country in livability.This is an historic time in Seattle, particularly because growth 
management has been an unmitigated failure
. Traﬃ   c is a mess, housing 
is unaﬀ  ordable, bridges are crumbling, and our neighbors are literally 
sleeping in the streets.  As President of Seattle Fair Growth, I have 
been advocating for housing for people of all incomes.
Before I built a small business from scratch into one of the Fastest 
Growing Companies in Washington, I was a starving radio announcer barely able to pay rent.  I know what it is to live paycheck to paycheck. We must incentivize developers to build aﬀ  ordable housing on site, not pay a fee to build it somewhere else on cheaper land four years later.
The recent update to Seattle’s Tree Ordinance is an example of the 
failure of our city’s leadership. Multiple amendments recommended by the Urban Forestry Commission were summarily rejected. Combined with the State’s Middle Housing Act, which requires multifamily zoning throughout Seattle, who stands for the trees? Are we the Emerald City or beholden to special interests? Subsidized multifamily housing close to transit is part of the balance that Seattle needs. We can have trees and we can have aﬀ  ordable housing too.
As your future City Council member, I will not be taking contributions 
from the Master Builders of King County. I will be working for one constituency, you. Together we can make Seattle green again!

Statement: Seattle, we need to pivot. Our city is heading toward a 
higher-cost, lower-quality of life. We’ve taken the wrong approach to our problems, let them get worse, and used the wrong tools to manage them.
Take homelessness . The current approach is to help people living 
on the streets so they can get back on their feet. The reality is most 
chronically homeless people have never been on their feet. Most suﬀ  er from mental illness and addiction problems. They don’t need free meals or shelter. They need rehab and treatment.
We need a Social Services Department to provide these services 
and handle many problems currently falling to the Seattle Police Department. Let’s not criminalize homelessness, but treat it as a public health issue. If necessary, we should use civil commitment  laws 
to mandate treatment for those who are a danger to themselves or others.
We’ve also taken the wrong approach to housing , believing that more 
supply will lower prices. But despite all the homes we’ve built, rents 
and prices still rise. That’s because private developers only build market rate housing as long as market rates remain high. We need to build aﬀ  ordable housing for people who earn at or below the median income. The new social housing oﬃ   ce is a step in this direction.
Addressing homelessness and housing aﬀ  ordability will chart a new 
path for Seattle. People in crisis will get the help they need. The police can stay in their lane. Our libraries can be learning centers instead of de facto homeless shelters. Our jails will no longer function as mental institutions. Our parks will be free of tents and needles.
Let’s pull Seattle in this hopeful direction, toward a higher-quality of 
life for everyone.

Occupation: Seattle City Councilmember; Attorney
Statement: As the parent of a six-month-old, I’m more determined 
than ever to build a Seattle we can be proud to pass on to the next generation. In my ﬁ  rst term, I brought together unlikely coalitions to deliver results and I’ll continue that work if re-elected.
Public Safety: In my ﬁ  rst term, I increased our park ranger program 
from two to 28 rangers, fully funded the police hiring budget each year, passed an ordinance protecting ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters from harassment in the line of duty, and worked with Mayor Harrell to create a civilian behavioral health response in lieu of police involvement. If re-elected, I’ll increase these alternative responses, continue the shared commitment of the Council and Mayor to recruit and retain police, and support community programs proven to reduce repeated criminal behavior.
Housing And Homelessness : We need to get people out of 
encampments and into stable housing immediately. Working with 
Mayor Harrell, my oﬃ   ce helped create the Uniﬁ  ed Care Team, a one-stop, no-excuses shop to navigate people experiencing homelessness into shelter and resolve encampments. Encampments have been reduced by 42%, but much work remains. Over the next four years, I’ll increase enhanced shelter options like tiny houses so people experiencing homelessness have a stable shelter, rather than being displaced to another encampment. I’ll also work with city partners to build and acquire social and non-proﬁ  t housing so more people can aﬀ  ord to live in our community.
Climate Change
: We are running out of time to combat climate change.

Occupation: Software Engineer, Amazon
Statement: I am running to build a lot of housing. The cost of living 
is high and increasing, and must be addressed by all means possible. Building more housing is the highest priority and will improve aﬀ  ordability, reduce inequality and homelessness, help mitigate climate change, create more walkable neighborhoods, and make transit more viable. Housing will also close the gap between workers and jobs, unlocking enormous economic potential. We will do this with permissive and ﬂ  exible zoning, by streamlining development processes, and by aligning tax incentives.
We must also improve our tax system. Our taxes are regressive and 
unstable, and the city faces major budget shortfalls. We should move to a land value tax, which will be more progressive, more consistent, increase tax revenue, and come at a lower cost to taxpayers. Land value taxes will encourage housing construction, discourage speculation, and ensure the public receives the full return on public investments, helping fund major transit projects.
We must expand addiction treatment services, and work to get as 
many people into treatment as possible, reducing drug use and overdoses. We must expand homeless outreach and shelter, to ensure we are consistently working with all of our large and growing homeless population and that we have space indoors for them. Nobody should sleep outside or in their car.
We must fully staﬀ   our police department, which is overworked and 
struggling to perform even its basic duties. Expanding social services will help reduce low-level property crime and save police time by addressing societal ills that the police are not meant for.
I am optimistic about our future: our problems have solutions, and 
great things are possible. I ask for your vote to start building that future.

Statement: We urgently need change at City Hall. It’s critical to act 
now and get Seattle back on the right track. As an immigrant, a small business owner, and a mom — not a politician — I understand the 
urgency to address the failures we’ve witnessed. The blatant dismissal 
of businesses, the ignorance and arrogance at City Hall, and the turning a blind eye to our safety.
The recent string of shootings that forced me to close my bakery 
on Third Avenue compelled me to take action. I pledge to you: no more excuses on homelessness, no more defunding the police, and no more neglecting downtown. Seattle can be transformed, but it requires more than empty political promises.
As Washington’s Business Owner of the Year, I’m committed to 
revitalizing downtown by bringing back small/minority-owned businesses and vibrant community events. To address homelessness, I’ll hire more police oﬃ   cers and add new crisis responders for non-violent calls.
I immigrated to America in ‘99 and graduated from Ballard High, so 
I understand the importance of community. My family and I made Piroshky Piroshky bakeries a Seattle staple. And with 70 Seattle based employees who spread piroshky love across the country, I prioritize living wages, healthcare, ﬁ  nancial security, and work-life balance — values that all businesses should embrace.
Politics as usual is falling short, that’s why I am running to challenge 
the status quo. I’ll be a voice for ordinary families whom City Hall has neglected and pushed aside. My commitment is solely to you — the people of Seattle. I have no special interests in my corner, and I have no ambition for higher oﬃ   ce. My aim is simple: to restore common-sense in city government.

The City of Seattle must Elect a Leader capable of working with other

that will address the crises  that have left thousands on Seattle’s 
sidewalks, streets, and parks where criminal activity continues to run rampant; improve public safety while re-building trust  between the 
public safety providers; ensure all elected oﬃ   cials are held accountable 
and keep the promises they make to during campaigns; urgently 
deal with waste that continues to accumulate  around the City and its 
perimeter in order to keep Seattle green; balance a budget  
and conduct 
regular audits to ensure the needs of the general public are prioritized over ‘special interest(s)’; establish training sites
 for individuals displaced

We need to get serious about crime reduction. The Council’s pledge to 
defund SPD by 50% was irresponsible and undercut our public safety and our ability to implement reform. I support allocating additional 
resources to recruitment, training, and community policing – including 
non-police responders. 
We cannot solve our public safety issues without addressing public 
health. With increasing shelter space, it’s time to restore our public spaces and stop relying on unsafe, inhumane encampments. City Council has enabled open drug use and drug dealing in our neighborhoods including downtown, which claimed the lives of 500+ Seattleites last year. We need leadership able to partner with County, State, and Federal authorities, to add mental health hospital capacity and addiction treatment centers. We must also prioritize programs and service providers that prove they work. I’ll focus Seattle 
government on saving lives, keeping the vulnerable safe, and restoring 
our beautiful city.
We can do this! I’m Bob Kettle, and I ask for your vote.

Seattle School District No. 1
/circle_arrow_right Director District No. 1
Education: Applied science degree in electronic engineering
Occupation: Technical consultant to the software industry
Statement: I have a long career in quality control, project 
management and auditing of ﬁ  nancial data systems. I will bring a high level of process scrutiny and logical problem solving to help in the school board’s decision making process.  I will use these skills in 
working with other board members and district staﬀ   to root out waste 
or ineﬃ   ciencies that exist in our school district management. 
This is my third campaign running for the Seattle school board and we all know it’s diﬃ   cult to get elected in Seattle unless you are seen as an 
activist. I’m not an activist just a Seattle Public Schools graduate and father of 3 Seattle Public School’s students who wants to see some 
stability , logic and ﬁ  scal responsibility return to Seattle Public Schools management. I believe my experience can help this district by pushing 
the narrative around school safety, the budget shortfall, capacity planning and outsourcing departments but it won’t be just talk!
I’m pledging at a minimum to have open and honest bi-weekly 
community meetings and an open door policy for anyone who needs help.
Please vote for me.Michael Christophersen

Education: Bachelor of Arts in Theater, Whitman College; Masters of 
Fine Arts Theater Design Brandeis University
Occupation: School Board Director; Adjunct Lecturer, Mom, 
Community Organizer, Nonproﬁ  t LeaderStatement: As your current School Board Vice President and a 
longtime PTSA leader, I’ve worked over a decade alongside families, educators, and communities across Seattle. I know the incredible 
successes of our schools, and the systemic and institutional challenges 
we face. I’m running to continue working to improve experiences and outcomes for our students, guided by community vision and values.
Over three challenging years, I have demonstrated a deep 
understanding of the issues and complexities facing our schools. 
Throughout the ever-changing pandemic landscape, I worked to make 
positive changes centered on student well-being, from volunteering at COVID test sites and in schools, to championing gun violence prevention and legislation, and leading on inclusive education policy changes in Instructional Philosophy and Special Education.
As the Board’s Legislative Liaison I helped secure additional state 
resources for special education, access to career and technical education, and behavioral health support for students recovering from pandemic disruption and trauma. I led eﬀ  orts to ban isolation and limit restraint in SPS – practices that disproportionately impact students of color and with disabilities. Our policy is a state model for preventative and restorative practices that address high needs and 
cultivate safe, culturally responsive learning environments that beneﬁ  t 
all children.
Together, we can meet the needs of our diverse learners and make 
our public schools the top choice for education for Seattle’s families. I’m committed to navigating budget and enrollment challenges with transparency, clarity, and community partnership– to maximize student beneﬁ  t while operating within our means. I will continue putting my skills and experience to work to rebuild not only trust and 
conﬁ  dence, but joy and excitement throughout our education system. 
I ask for your vote.

Education: Western Washington University, Political Change through 
Feminist and Ethnic Studies; Seattle University, Teaching Certiﬁ  cate
Occupation: Educator (early learning), Advocacy Consultant, 
Washington Communities for Children
Statement: Representation matters. Our public schools have been 
critical at bringing opportunity and learning to generations of Seattle’s children but we have much more work to do to increase academic achievement, ensure every student has a healthy and inclusive learning environment and the school district is managed with transparency and accountability.  I’ve lived in Seattle for 27 years and over the past 15 years, I served on the Best Start for Kids Advisory Board, as Executive Director of an LGBTQ+ nonproﬁ  t, as an Interim Policy Director for NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) Washington, and as Mobilization contractor for Children’s Alliance. I was a community organizer for Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 8 and currently serve as the co-chair of the Policy and Advocacy Committee for the 46th District Democrats.  As Olympic Hills PTA Advocacy Chair, I have a ﬁ  rsthand understanding of the challenges and opportunities in our schools.
I’m running to be a strong LGBTQ+ voice on the school board and 
ensure children of all identities feel a sense of belonging in their schools. The inequities in academic achievement still need urgent attention and focus to make the Seattle School District the exemplary learning environment we all want it to be. My vision in becoming a School Board Director is:
Ensuring every student feels a sense of belonging in their school. That 
no matter what your identity is, students can thrive and feel safe while 
gaining a high-quality education; Implementing a robust community 
engagement process especially when big district decisions need to be made that center the communities farthest from educational opportunities; Bringing more transparency back in the budget and policy development process.
I’m excited to take my experience in education, community organizing, 
and labor to get pragmatic results for all students. I’d be honored to earn your vote.

Education: SPS, some college and life experiences that done need a 
degree or certiﬁ  cate.
Occupation: I am a full time grocery/retail worker and parent/
volunteerStatement: I am enrolled member of the Assiniboine Sioux from 
Fort Peck MT. I was born here in Seattle WA, and have graduated from Seattle Public Schools.  Having lived here my whole life I have and am still raising my six children, ﬁ  ve of whom attend/attended Seattle Public Schools. Having my older children attending SPS, I have 
volunteered in numerous schools and have seen many challenges that 
our underserved and marginalized populations go through.
In the past I have worked with a nonproﬁ  t organization and some 
alumni to help make a site a city landmark in Seattle. The Wilson 
Paciﬁ  c site located in North Seattle, just north of greenlake was slated 
for demolition to build two “Mega” schools. This decision was voted on and approved and had a high impact from the HCC parents and 
supporters. Leaving community members and organization, little to no 
voice and displacing them. Now, the district is making the same move across the district.  I ask again, how is this cost eﬀ  ective and helping the 
needs of our students if SPS will dismantle their schools and community?
Volunteering in our schools, I have seen the day to day our teachers 
face. As we look forward, we are looking at the changes that would be made to SPS under enrolled schools and those communities.  There are so many other ways we can look at the budget and help our students have tools they need to succeed.  We are a small school, and I hope to make some change and give our school the same opportunity to continue to educate our future leaders.
I do have, questions and concerns, I will learn and I will adapt, I 
hope to help all our students across the district and our families and community in D1.

Education: MFA in Documentary Film and Video, Stanford University; 
BA in Literature, Duke University
Occupation: documentary ﬁ  lmmaker
Statement: At its best, education opens doors and unlocks potential. 
Yet in a city of abundant resources, we face persistent opportunity gaps that are among the worst in our nation. As the parent of three SPS students, one of my core beliefs is that we advocate most eﬀ  ectively for our own children when we advocate for all children. We 
must align our district to focus on student outcomes, such that every 
child in this city receives the education they deserve.
From running a summer program for children of East African refugees to teaching at the college level, I have spent time in the classroom and 
understand the unique challenges our educators face. From a parent 
perspective, my eﬀ  orts to secure the support necessary for my child to thrive at school have been met with frustrating roadblocks. As a board member, I will hold myself accountable for advocating for policies that 
support and empower our educators to help our kids reach their full potential.
Children are facing an unprecedented mental health crisis. Our 
schools are facing a budget crisis. And data show that too many students in our district are profoundly underserved. Addressing these issues requires big picture thinking and a systems approach to enacting meaningful change. 
Having served on PTAs and the Magnuson Park Advisory Committee, 
I understand that systemic change doesn’t happen overnight. I also understand that successful movements are grounded in relationship 
building, which is why I will advocate for inclusive engagement policies 
and proactive, transparent communication.
I chose a career in ﬁ  lmmaking because I believe stories shape how 
we see and understand the world. They have the power to transform. Together, let’s create a new story about education in Seattle.

Occupation: parent and advocate
Statement: Employment and Community Service :  Seattle Special 
Education PTSA. Thornton Creek PTA. Business Operations - Root 
Academy. Software Development Manager - Geospiza. Lab tech - Case 
Western Reserve University.What makes public schools special? It’s the collective eﬀ  ort by 
families, teachers, and neighbors to craft an educational vision, 
support its implementation, and make it available to every child in our 
community. 
I’m running for School Board because I believe I can help bring Seattle 
Public Schools closer to this ideal. 
Right now, our public schools are struggling to meet our vision. 
Despite great teachers and caring community members, the insuﬃ   cient state and federal funding and long-standing budget and leadership diﬃ   culties have left Seattle Public Schools, our educators, and our children in a diﬃ   cult situation.
As a parent and advocate deeply involved in special education, I bring 
a passion for inclusion and educational justice. I am dedicated to ensuring that every child has access to a welcoming and supportive environment that nurtures their growth and success. I believe the school board has a critical role to play in the functioning of our school system.
My key initiatives include fostering welcoming school environments, 
strengthening community engagement, transparency, and oversight, 
and addressing special education failings. These are the initiatives and 
values that will guide me on the school board. They will inform how I work with the public and our school communities to address our 
district’s ﬁ  nancial needs and our ongoing shortcomings in delivering a 
great education. I am dedicated to cultivating an inclusive, equitable, and eﬀ  ective educational system. I will engage with community, increase oversight and accountability, and I will always center the vision that public school should be a place where every child can succeed. I look forward to working together to support our public schools!

Education: MBA, University of Washington, Bachelors in Arts, 
Middlebury College
Occupation: Product, Google Cloud; previously Director, Washington 
Low Income Housing AllianceStatement: Seattle is a progressive, educated, and innovative city, but 
our Public Schools are failing too many kids, teachers, and families. There is a real but quiet crisis in our schools: pandemic disruptions, declining enrollment, budget instability, and widening gaps in equity and outcomes. I am running for School Board because I believe that we can meet this challenge and build great schools for all families.
I’ve called Seattle home for 20 years. I’ve fought for housing 
aﬀ  ordability as the Executive Director of the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance. I’ve worked at leading technology companies. I’ve been a proud SPS parent– volunteering for school plays, chess club, and fundraising events. Our kids have had dedicated, talented, and committed teachers. 
We need systemic change to address urgent needs . After a student 
died from gun violence at Ingraham High School there was little to 
no response. The Board and District intend to close neighborhood schools and have ended vital enrichment programs. Students furthest from educational justice are, using the District’s own measures, worse oﬀ   than they were in 2019. The constant budget panic is a result of a fundamentally unsound ﬁ  nancial footing with no plans to make real changes. As a result, many parents who can are leaving for private schools.
We deserve a School Board that takes gun violence seriously. We 
deserve a Board that ﬁ  ghts to keep neighborhood schools open and oﬀ  er programs that draw students in. We deserve a Board that does more than talk about improving the education of the kids most in need of our help, but insists on results. I don’t have all the answers, 
but I believe that bringing in new voices is the ﬁ  rst step to getting back 
on the right track. 
I would appreciate your vote. My views are my own, not my employer’s.

Occupation: Shelter Counselor at New Horizons Ministries
Statement: My name is Rosie she/her/they/them/their pronouns.
Thank you for this opportunity. I work at New Horizons Ministries with homeless young adults and a few grassroots organizations. I am running because I feel like low income familes which make up a signiﬁ  cant majority of the population of Seattle aren’t being heard nor truly represented. Also I am tired of the dumpster ﬁ  re we call the education system. We are failing the children and disproportionally kids that are part of the BIPOC communities. Not to mention low income families and the kids that qualify for special education and those furthest from educational justice. I am considered ‘low-income’ born and raised. Sitting below the poverty line. I am a Native, a proud Cherokee and Nez Perce . A member and family in the  LGBTQIA 2 spirit community. I am neurodiverse as is my youngest. Which has received or are receiving special education services. As low-income my family depends on free meals at school, Apple Health, and Food Stamps. No one knows or understands the struggles of poverty like someone who’s lived it or is living it. I feel that anywhere decisions are being made everyone should be present and have a say. My lived experience tells me that now is the best time to run for the school board position. I have the knowledge and skills bestowed upon me by amazing programs like Policy Council with the PSESD, The Agents of Change Cohort, and most importantly Washington State Association 
of head start and early head start Parent Ambassadors program. They 
have provided me with the tools I need to work with my communities and advocate for them. I hope you will allow me to do that.

Education: University of Washington: Bachelor’s Degree, Biology; Juris 
Doctor; Master’s Degree, Tax Law
Occupation: Lawyer and West Seattle mom; former Counsel, MLK 
County ExecutiveStatement: Growing up in Washington, I experienced ﬁ  rsthand the 
struggles of our underfunded schools. Still, my life was transformed by the teachers and counselors who went above and beyond to support me. Now, as I prepare to send my daughter into the same underfunded system, like many other parents, I’m worried.
Seattle Public Schools faces a staggering $131 million budget shortfall 
for the 2023-2024 school year. The board is discussing cutting buses and music programs, laying oﬀ   teachers, and even closing schools. It’s clear we need experienced leaders prepared to tackle these issues head-on with innovative solutions and an unwavering commitment to our kids.
I am well equipped to help bring stability and transformation to our 
schools, restoring parental and community conﬁ  dence. As chief legal counsel and policy advisor to the King County Executive, I managed complex policy and budget challenges - working to prioritize equity, accountability, and delivery of services.
With your vote, my top priorities will be: 1)  Ensuring equity
 in education 
for all students, regardless of their background, so that every child 
has the opportunity to succeed; 2) Cultivating safe, inclusive, and welcoming environments , where every student feels valued and 
respected; 3) Empowering educators  through comprehensive support 
and fostering their professional growth, recognizing their critical role in shaping our children’s future; 4) Engaging parents and communities 
to create a collaborative educational system that restores conﬁ  dence in the governance of our district, and reﬂ  ects the diverse needs and perspectives of our city.
Together, I believe we can create a Seattle Public Schools system 
where parents and students look forward to the start of each school day.
I am grateful to have early endorsements from local leaders including 
Executive Dow Constantine, State Representatives Emily Alvarado and Joe Fitzgibbon, and Seattle School Board Director Leslie Harris.

Occupation: Advocate for Women in Recovery for 35 years
Statement: Statement:  40-year West Seattle resident, 3 grandchildren 
in Seattle Public Schools (SPS), 1 with special needs.Restoring conﬁ  dence in our schools that have lost the support of 
families and communities they serve is key. Parents, students, and teachers need to be better informed and consulted about education demands and budget priorities. SPS’s decision making process lacks 
transparency. Elect me to the School Board and I will work tirelessly to 
change that. 
Seattle Public Schools faces declining enrollments, budget 
deﬁ  cits, elimination of resources and programs, possible closures, consolidation, teacher and staﬀ   layoﬀ  s according to an article published by the Seattle Times in April of 2023.  SPS is facing an 
estimated $131 million deﬁ  cit for 2023-24 and $92 million for 2024-25 
yet they are still planning to construct large, one-size-ﬁ  ts-all buildings to replace aging schools.
I live by Alki Elemetary which is proposed for a giant expansion despite 
city declining enrollment. This will harmfully close other schools. I will vote to halt and dial back this project. There are similar harmful projects at Montlake and Rogers Elementaries.
The new schools provide no parking for staﬀ   or parents. ADA parking 
is insuﬃ   cient.The Alki school rebuild and remodel is an example of this. I will work tirelessly to  make sure projects are scaled back if they 
can’t be paid for or don’t have full community support.  If you can’t get 
your chilld to the school, they can’t be educated.
