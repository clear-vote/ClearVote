Education: SPS, some college and life experiences that done need a 
degree or certiﬁ  cate.
Occupation: I am a full time grocery/retail worker and parent/
volunteerStatement: I am enrolled member of the Assiniboine Sioux from 
Fort Peck MT. I was born here in Seattle WA, and have graduated from Seattle Public Schools.  Having lived here my whole life I have and am still raising my six children, ﬁ  ve of whom attend/attended Seattle Public Schools. Having my older children attending SPS, I have 
volunteered in numerous schools and have seen many challenges that 
our underserved and marginalized populations go through.
In the past I have worked with a nonproﬁ  t organization and some 
alumni to help make a site a city landmark in Seattle. The Wilson 
Paciﬁ  c site located in North Seattle, just north of greenlake was slated 
for demolition to build two “Mega” schools. This decision was voted on and approved and had a high impact from the HCC parents and 
supporters. Leaving community members and organization, little to no 
voice and displacing them. Now, the district is making the same move across the district.  I ask again, how is this cost eﬀ  ective and helping the 
needs of our students if SPS will dismantle their schools and community?
Volunteering in our schools, I have seen the day to day our teachers 
face. As we look forward, we are looking at the changes that would be made to SPS under enrolled schools and those communities.  There are so many other ways we can look at the budget and help our students have tools they need to succeed.  We are a small school, and I hope to make some change and give our school the same opportunity to continue to educate our future leaders.
I do have, questions and concerns, I will learn and I will adapt, I 
hope to help all our students across the district and our families and community in D1.
