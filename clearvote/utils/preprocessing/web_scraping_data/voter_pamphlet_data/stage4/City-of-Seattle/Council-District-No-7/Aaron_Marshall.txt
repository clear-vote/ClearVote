Education: Seattle Central Community College - Associate of Arts
Occupation: Seattle Police Oﬃ   cer - Community Response Group
Statement: Steward - The careful and responsible management of 
something entrusted to one’s care. As a citizen of Seattle and longtime 
resident of District 7, we have to ask ourselves, “Do we have a good 
steward in Seattle?”
When I talk about issues in this city, it is because the past decade of 
my life has been spent in all corners of Seattle, serving the public, and adapting to issues we face.
I am a Seattle Police Oﬃ   cer who works on a team called the 
Community Response Group, working to address the most diﬃ   cult 
issues the city faces. I have been an Oﬃ   cer since 2013, and was drawn 
to SPD because of my deep ties to the city.
I have lived in Seattle for over twenty years. This is my home -I refuse 
to give up on this city regardless of how bruised and battered we are. Seattle is in Crisis and needs direction. I am an Independent voice 
for common sense change. I am neither Republican nor Democrat. I represent the majority who have been without a voice for too long.
I am a United States Marine Corps veteran. I was in the restaurant 
industry for nearly two decades, mostly in Queen Anne, and won Seattle’s Best Bartender award twice. I know my constituents, my small and medium sized businesses, and I know my district.
Our community is being torn apart by fentanyl, meth and an unabated mental health crisis - and I have seen the eﬀ  ects ﬁ  rst-hand. There is a 
way out of this - and that way requires dedication to working through challenges proactively. The critical issues of public safety, addiction, mental health, homelessness, aﬀ  ordable housing, transportation, taxes, workers small & medium sized businesses and livability of this city can be found in detail on my website: marshallforseattle.com
