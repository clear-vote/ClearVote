Statement: I am running to build a lot of housing. The cost of living 
is high and increasing, and must be addressed by all means possible. Building more housing is the highest priority and will improve aﬀ  ordability, reduce inequality and homelessness, help mitigate climate change, create more walkable neighborhoods, and make transit more viable. Housing will also close the gap between workers and jobs, unlocking enormous economic potential. We will do this with permissive and ﬂ  exible zoning, by streamlining development processes, and by aligning tax incentives.
We must also improve our tax system. Our taxes are regressive and 
unstable, and the city faces major budget shortfalls. We should move to a land value tax, which will be more progressive, more consistent, increase tax revenue, and come at a lower cost to taxpayers. Land value taxes will encourage housing construction, discourage speculation, and ensure the public receives the full return on public investments, helping fund major transit projects.
We must expand addiction treatment services, and work to get as 
many people into treatment as possible, reducing drug use and overdoses. We must expand homeless outreach and shelter, to ensure we are consistently working with all of our large and growing homeless population and that we have space indoors for them. Nobody should sleep outside or in their car.
We must fully staﬀ   our police department, which is overworked and 
struggling to perform even its basic duties. Expanding social services will help reduce low-level property crime and save police time by addressing societal ills that the police are not meant for.
I am optimistic about our future: our problems have solutions, and 
great things are possible. I ask for your vote to start building that future.
