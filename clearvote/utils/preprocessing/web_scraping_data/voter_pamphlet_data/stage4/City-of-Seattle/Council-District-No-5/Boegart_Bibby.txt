Education: B of A Linguistics, A+, Network+, Security+, and Microsoft 
Certiﬁ  ed Technology Consultant.
Occupation: Sr. IT Supervisor for Americas Region.
Statement: In 2013, The Lake City Community Center had been 
begging the city for months to install Wi-Fi, with delay after delay and no action. The community needed a solution so I volunteered, got on the roof, and installed the ﬁ  rst Wireless Internet system at the LCCC.
Sadly, a decade later nothing has changed. We watch volunteers take 
action and get results, while the programs City Hall pours millions into 
seem ineﬀ  ective. We have been patient and generous with our tax 
dollars, but we’re not getting our fair share or a fair say on spending. Accountability is my top priority. We need to enhance auditing of city expenditures, identify what is working and cut wasteful spending.
Having lived in north Seattle for almost 25 years, some of you know 
me from my prior business, The Computer Doctor. Some of you know me from my contributions at the Eagles Aerie #1. I’m proud to be an active participant in our community, contributing to making it better.
I believe IT Management principles can change City Hall. Examining 
problems and ﬁ  nding solutions (within budget) is what I do every day. 
I will make sure your voice is heard, because I will conduct a survey 
every 3 months and focus on what you want from city government.  
I also am a proud advocate of civil rights, and the right to choose. The 
anti-choice movement is based on two lies. The ﬁ  rst lie is every fetus is viable, the second lie is that pregnancy and birth don’t pose a life-threatening risk. In 2022, the US had the highest maternal mortality rate. Protecting civil rights is not enough. We have a moral obligation to audit and ensure our tax dollars are not feeding anti-choice organizations.
