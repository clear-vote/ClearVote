Statement: A college student and native of North Seattle, Lucca 
Murdoch Howard is deeply familiar with issues facing District Five. Aﬀ  ording rent, much less mortgage, is drifting out of reach for most residents. Seniors and students alike have to choose between moving out of city limits or facing tough choices. Basic problems are ignored in our bus network, making driving mandatory, and creating parking problems across the district. Aurora hasn’t been invested in for decades, being so decrepit that neighbors avoid it when it could be a business area and urban hub. Across North Seattle, communities are ignored by city hall--most District Five neighborhoods have no community center or voice in Seattle’s growth.
As Seattle’s youngest City Council member, Lucca will bring a 
fresh perspective for our district. He will listen to the community, and advocate for their solutions. Lucca worked on I-135, and will assure the Seattle Social Housing Developer is funded to relieve homelessness. Aurora should be a proper Main Street, by bringing bus, bike, and pedestrian infrastructure to places that don’t have them. 
Lucca’s main priorities are transit, aﬀ  ordable housing, and community 
improvements. He will prioritize community-based, sustainable solutions so that young people can start to thrive in Seattle.
