Statement:  As a Christian, a Father, and your next City Council 
Representative; I will serve our di5trict with the humility, transparency and with the wisdom of our collective community to deliver on a future our children deserve. My campaign will focus our Care on:
Systemic Racism; People deserve to be treated with Care and basic 
human dignity regardless of sex, orientation, gender, nationality of 
birth, or color of skin. I am commited to Police Reform and for equality 
under our laws.  
Homeless Crisis; One only needs to walk our streets and in some 
cases just look out of your oﬃ   ce window or out of your bed room window to see the crisis we face regarding homelessness in this city and the 2023/24 budget has earmarked nearly $320million dollars to Care for unhoused in Seattle. I will ensure that every dollar ensures a better future for Seattleites struggling out of poverty. 
Psalm 82: “Be fair to the poor and to orphans. Defend the helpless and 
everyone in need. Rescue the weak and homeless from the powerful hands of heartless people” 
Fair and Good Paying Jobs; The unfair union busting actions we’ve 
seen in recent years by Seattle’s most well-known industries must end 
and be held to account. As your representative in City Council, I will 
work with trades and union organizers to ensure fair demands are met with Care.
Our Environment; As Your representative for district 5, I will ensure that our needs are being met as well to ensure cleaner parks for our kids to play in, upgraded equipment for them to enjoy, protected bike 
lanes for you to commute to work and tax dollars for businesses ready 
to be net-zero carbon today.
